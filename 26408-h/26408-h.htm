<h2>A BUDGET OF PARADOXES.</h2>

<h3>VOLUME II.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">ON SOME PHILOSOPHICAL ATHEISTS.</p>

  <p>With the general run of the philosophical atheists of the last century
  the notion of a God was an hypothesis. There was left an admitted
  possibility that the vague somewhat which went by more names than one,
  might be personal, intelligent, and superintendent. In the works of
  Laplace,<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> who is sometimes
  called an atheist from his writings, there is nothing from which such an
  inference can be drawn: unless indeed a Reverend Fellow of the Royal
  Society may be held to be the fool who said in his heart, etc., etc., if
  his contributions to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> go no higher
  than <i>nature</i>. The following anecdote is well known in Paris, but
  has never been printed entire. Laplace once went in form to present some
  edition of his "Système du Monde" to the First Consul, or Emperor.
  Napoleon, whom some wags had told that this book contained no mention of
  the name of God, and who was fond of putting embarrassing questions,
  received it with&mdash;"M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this
  large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned
  its Creator." Laplace, who, though the most supple of politicians, was as
  stiff as a martyr on every point of his philosophy or religion (e. g.,
  even under Charles X he never concealed his dislike of the priests), drew
  himself up and answered <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>[2]</span>bluntly, "Je n'avais pas besoin de cette
  hypothèse-là."<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Napoleon,
  greatly amused, told this reply to Lagrange, who exclaimed, "Ah! c'est
  une belle hypothèse; ça explique beaucoup de choses."<a name="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is commonly said that the last words of Laplace were, "Ce que nous
  connaissons est peu de chose; ce que nous ignorons est immense."<a
  name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> This looks like a parody on
  Newton's pebbles:<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the
  following is the true account; it comes to me through one remove from
  Poisson.<a name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> After the
  publication (in 1825) of the fifth volume of the <i>Mécanique
  Céleste</i>, Laplace became gradually weaker, and with it musing and
  abstracted. He thought much on the great problems of existence, and often
  muttered to himself, <i>Qu'est ce que c'est que tout cela!</i><a
  name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> After many alternations, he
  appeared at last so permanently prostrated that his family applied to his
  favorite pupil, M. Poisson, to try to get a word from him. Poisson paid a
  visit, and after a few words of salutation, said, "J'ai une bonne
  nouvelle à vous annoncer: on a reçu au Bureau des Longitudes une lettre
  d'Allemagne annonçant que M. Bessel a vérifié par l'observation vos
  découvertes théoriques sur les satellites de Jupiter."<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Laplace opened his eyes and answered with
  deep <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>[3]</span>gravity, "<i>L'homme ne poursuit que des
  chimères</i>."<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> He never
  spoke again. His death took place March 5, 1827.</p>

  <p>The language used by the two great geometers illustrates what I have
  said: a supreme and guiding intelligence&mdash;apart from a blind rule
  called <i>nature of things</i>&mdash;was an <i>hypothesis</i>. The
  absolute denial of such a ruling power was not in the plan of the higher
  philosophers: it was left for the smaller fry. A round assertion of the
  non-existence of anything which stands in the way is the refuge of a
  certain class of minds: but it succeeds only with things subjective; the
  objective offers resistance. A philosopher of the appropriative class
  tried it upon the constable who appropriated <i>him</i>: I deny your
  existence, said he; Come along all the same, said the unpsychological
  policeman.</p>

  <p>Euler<a name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> was a believer
  in God, downright and straightforward. The following story is told by
  Thiébault,<a name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> in his
  <i>Souvenirs de vingt ans de séjour à Berlin</i>,<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> published in his old age, about 1804.
  This volume was fully received as trustworthy; and Marshall Mollendorff<a
  name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> told the Duc de Bassano<a
  name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> in 1807 that it was the
  most veracious of books written by the most honest of men. Thiébault says
  that he has no personal knowledge of the truth of the story, but <!--
  Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[4]</span>that it was
  believed throughout the whole of the north of Europe. Diderot<a
  name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> paid a visit to the
  Russian Court at the invitation of the Empress. He conversed very freely,
  and gave the younger members of the Court circle a good deal of lively
  atheism. The Empress was much amused, but some of her councillors
  suggested that it might be desirable to check these expositions of
  doctrine. The Empress did not like to put a direct muzzle on her guest's
  tongue, so the following plot was contrived. Diderot was informed that a
  learned mathematician was in possession of an algebraical demonstration
  of the existence of God, and would give it him before all the Court, if
  he desired to hear it. Diderot gladly consented: though the name of the
  mathematician is not given, it was Euler. He advanced towards Diderot,
  and said gravely, and in a tone of perfect conviction: <i>Monsieur,</i>
  (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>) / <i>n</i> = <i>x</i>, <i>donc
  Dieu existe; répondez!</i><a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Diderot, to whom algebra was Hebrew,
  was embarrassed and disconcerted; while peals of laughter rose on all
  sides. He asked permission to return to France at once, which was
  granted.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>An examination of the Astronomical doctrine of the Moon's rotation. By
  J.&nbsp;L.<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Edinburgh, 1847,
  8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A systematic attack of the character afterwards made with less skill
  and more notice by Mr. Jellinger Symons.</p>

  <p>July 1866, J.&nbsp;L. appears as Mr. James Laurie, with a new pamphlet "The
  Astronomical doctrines of the Moon's rotation ..." Edinburgh. Of all the
  works I have seen on the question, this is the most confident, and the
  sorest. <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>[5]</span>A writer on astronomy said of Mr. Jellinger
  Symons,<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> "Of course he
  convinced no one who knew anything of the subject." This "ungenerous
  slur" on the speculator's memory appears to have been keenly felt; but
  its truth is admitted. Those who knew anything of the subject are "the
  so-called men of science," whose three P's were assailed; prestige,
  pride, and prejudice: this the author tries to effect for himself with
  three Q's; quibble, quirk, and quiddity. He explains that the Scribes and
  Pharisees would not hear Jesus, and that the lordly bishop of Rome will
  not cast his tiara and keys at the feet of the "humble presbyter" who now
  plays the part of pope in Scotland. I do not know whom he means: but
  perhaps the friends of the presbyter-pope may consider this an ungenerous
  slur. The best proof of the astronomer is just such "as might have been
  expected from the merest of blockheads"; but as the giver is of course
  not a blockhead, this circumstance shows how deeply blinded by prejudice
  he must be.</p>

  <p>Of course the paradoxers do not persuade any persons who know their
  subjects: and so these Scribes and Pharisees reject the Messiah. We must
  suppose that the makers of this comparison are Christians: for if they
  thought the Messiah an enthusiast or an impostor, they would be absurd in
  comparing those who reject what they take for truth with others who once
  rejected what they take for falsehood. And if Christians, they are both
  irreverent and blind to all analogy. The Messiah, with His Divine mission
  proved by miracles which all might see who chose to look, is degraded
  into a prototype of James Laurie, ingeniously astronomizing upon ignorant
  geometry and false logic, and comparing to blockheads those who expose
  his nonsense. Their comparison is as foolish as&mdash;supposing <!-- Page
  6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[6]</span>them
  Christians&mdash;it is profane: but, like errors in general, its other
  end points to truth. There were Pseudochrists and Antichrists; and a
  Concordance would find the real forerunners of all the paradoxers. But
  they are not so clever as the old false prophets: there are none of whom
  we should be inclined to say that, if it were possible, they would
  deceive the very educated. Not an Egyptian among them all can make uproar
  enough to collect four thousand men that are murderers&mdash;of common
  sense&mdash;to lead out into the wilderness. Nothing, says the motto of
  this work, is so difficult to destroy as the errors and false facts
  propagated by illustrious men whose words have authority. I deny it
  altogether. There are things much more difficult to destroy: it is much
  more difficult to destroy the truths and real facts supported by such
  men. And again, it is much more difficult to prevent men of no authority
  from setting up false pretensions; and it is much more difficult to
  destroy assertions of fancy speculation. Many an error of thought and
  learning has fallen before a gradual growth of thoughtful and learned
  opposition. But such things as the quadrature of the circle, etc., are
  never put down. And why? Because thought can influence thought, but
  thought cannot influence self-conceit: learning can annihilate learning:
  but learning cannot annihilate ignorance. A sword may cut through an iron
  bar; and the severed ends will not reunite: let it go through the air,
  and the yielding substance is whole again in a moment.</p>

  <p>The theory, as may be supposed, is carried further than most students
  of the subject would hold defensible.</p>

  <p>1847. In the <i>United Service Magazine</i> for September, 1847, Mrs.
  Borron,<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> of Shrewsbury,
  published some remarks tending to impeach the fact that Neptune, the
  planet found by Galle,<a name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
  really was the planet which Le Verrier and Adams<a name="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> had a right to claim. This was followed
  (September 14) by two pages, separately circulated, of "Further
  Observations upon the Planets Neptune and Uranus, with a Theory of
  Perturbations"; and (October 19, 1848) by three pages of "A Review of M.
  Leverrier's Exposition." Several persons, when the remarkable discovery
  was made, contended that the planet actually discovered was an intruder;
  and the future histories of the discovery must contain some account of
  this little afterpiece. Tim Linkinwater's theory that there is no place
  like London for coincidences, would have been utterly overthrown in favor
  of what they used to call the celestial spaces, if there had been a
  planet which by chance was put <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>In 1842-43 a Mr. Henson<a name="NtA_24"

  steam-engine, and a Bill was brought in to incorporate an "Aerial Transit

  being the explosion of mixed hydrogen and air. Nothing came of
  it&mdash;not even a Bill. What the final destiny of the balloon may be no
  one knows: it may reasonably be suspected that difficulties will at last
  be overcome. Darwin,<a name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> in
  his "Botanic Garden" (1781), has the following prophecy:</p>

      <p>The flying chariot through the fields of air."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Darwin's contemporaries, no doubt, smiled pity on the poor man. It is
  worth note that the two true prophecies have been fulfilled in a sense
  different from that of the predictions. Darwin was thinking of the
  suggestion of Jonathan Hulls,<a name="NtA_26"

  barge: it is only very recently that the steam-tug has been employed on
  the canals. The car was to be driven, not drawn, and on the common roads.
  Perhaps, the flying chariot will <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>"<i>Quadrature of the Circle</i>.&mdash;A quadrant is a curvilinear
  angle traversing round and at an equal distance from a given point,
  called a center, no two points in the curve being at the same angle, but
  irreptitiously graduating from 90 to 60. It is therefore a mean angle of
  90 and 60, which is 75, because it is more than 60, and less than 90,
  approximately from 60 to 90, and from 90 to 60, with equal generation in
  each irreptitious approximation, therefore meeting in 75, and which is
  the mean angle of the quadrant.</p>

  <p>"Or suppose a line drawn from a given point at 90, and from the same
  point at 60. Let each of these lines revolve on this point toward each
  other at an equal ratio. They will become one line at 75, and bisect the
  curve, which is one-sixth of the entire circle. The result, taking 16 as
  a diameter, gives an area of 201.072400, and a circumference of
  50.2681.</p>

  <p>"The original conception, its natural harmony, and the result, to my
  own mind is a demonstrative truth, which I presume it right to make
  known, though perhaps at the hazard of unpleasant if not uncourteous
  remarks."</p>

  <p>I have added punctuation: the handwriting and spelling <!-- Page 11

</blockquote>

  <p>The author published two tracts under this title, containing different
  alleged proofs: but neither gives any notice of the change. Both contain
  the same preface, complaining of the British Association for refusing to
  examine the production. I suppose that the author, finding his first
  proof wrong, invented the second, of which the Association never had the
  offer; and, feeling sure that they would have equally refused to examine
  the second, thought it justifiable to <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[13]</span>present that second as
  the one which they had refused. Mr. Upton has discovered that the common
  way of finding the circumference is wrong, would set it right if he had
  leisure, and, in the mean time, has solved the problem of the duplication
  of the cube.</p>

  <p><i>The trisector of an angle, if he demand attention from any
  mathematician, is bound to produce, from his construction, an expression
  for the sine or cosine of the third part of any angle, in terms of the
  sine or cosine of the angle itself, obtained by help of no higher than
  the square root.</i> The mathematician knows that such a thing cannot be;
  but the trisector virtually says it can be, and is bound to produce it,
  to save time. This is the misfortune of most of the solvers of the
  celebrated problems, that they have not knowledge enough to present those
  consequences of their results by which they can be easily judged.
  Sometimes they have the knowledge and quibble out of the use of it. In
  many cases a person makes an honest beginning and presents what he is
  sure is a solution. By conference with others he at last feels uneasy,
  fears the light, and puts self-love in the way of it. Dishonesty
  sometimes follows. The speculators are, as a class, very apt to imagine
  that the mathematicians are in fraudulent confederacy against them: I
  ought rather to say that each one of them consents to the mode in which
  the rest are treated, and fancies conspiracy against himself. The mania
  of conspiracy is a very curious subject. I do not mean these remarks to
  apply to the author before me.</p>

  <p>One of Mr. Upton's trisections, if true, would prove the truth of the
  following equation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>3 cos (<span class="grk">&theta;</span> / 3) = 1 + &radic;(4 - sin<sup>2</sup><span class="grk">&theta;</span>)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which is certainly false.<a name="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>[14]</span></p>

  <p>In 1852 I examined a terrific construction, at the request of the late
  Dr. Wallich,<a name="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> who was
  anxious to persuade a poor countryman of his, that trisection of the
  angle was waste of time. One of the principles was, that "magnitude and
  direction determine each other." The construction was equivalent to the
  assertion that, <span class="grk">&theta;</span> being any angle, the
  cosine of its third part is</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>sin 3<span class="grk">&theta;</span> . cos(5<span class="grk">&theta;</span>/2) + sin<sup>2</sup> <span class="grk">&theta;</span> sin (5<span class="grk">&theta;</span>/2)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>divided by the square root of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>sin<sup>2</sup> 3<span class="grk">&theta;</span> . cos<sup>2</sup> (5<span class="grk">&theta;</span>/2) + sin<sup>4</sup> <span class="grk">&theta;</span> + sin 3<span class="grk">&theta;</span> . sin 5<span class="grk">&theta;</span> . sin<sup>2</sup> <span class="grk">&theta;</span>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is from my rough notes, and I believe it is correct.<a
  name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> It is so nearly true,
  unless the angle be very obtuse, that common drawing, applied to the
  construction, will not detect the error. There are many formulae of this
  kind: and I have several times found a speculator who has discovered the
  corresponding construction, has seen the approximate success of his
  drawing&mdash;often as great as absolute truth could give in graphical
  practice,&mdash;and has then set about his demonstration, in which he
  always succeeds to his own content.</p>

  <p>There is a trisection of which I have lost both cutting and reference:
  I think it is in the <i>United Service Journal</i>. I could not detect
  any error in it, though certain there must <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[15]</span>be one. At least I
  discovered that two parts of the diagram were incompatible unless a
  certain point lay in line with two others, by which the angle to be
  trisected&mdash;and which was trisected&mdash;was bound to be either 0°
  or 180°.</p>

  <p>Aug. 22, 1866. Mr. Upton sticks to his subject. He has just published
  "The Uptonian Trisection. Respectfully dedicated to the schoolmasters of
  the United Kingdom." It seems to be a new attempt. He takes no notice of
  the sentence I have put in italics: nor does he mention my notice of him,
  unless he means to include me among those by whom he has been "ridiculed
  and sneered at" or "branded as a brainless heretic." I did neither one
  nor the other: I thought Mr. Upton a paradoxer to whom it was likely to
  be worth while to propound the definite assertion now in italics; and Mr.
  Upton does not find it convenient to take issue on the point. He prefers
  general assertions about algebra. So long as he cannot meet algebra on
  the above question, he may issue as many "respectful challenges" to the
  mathematicians as he can find paper to write: he will meet with no
  attention.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>There is one trisection which is of more importance than that of the
  angle. It is easy to get half the paper on which you write for margin; or
  a quarter; but very troublesome to get a third. Show us how, easily and
  certainly, to fold the paper into three, and you will be a real
  benefactor to society.</p>

  <p>Early in the century there was a Turkish trisector of the angle,
  Hussein Effendi, who published two methods. He was the father of Ameen
  Bey, who was well known in England thirty years ago as a most amiable and
  cultivated gentleman and an excellent mathematician. He was then a
  student at Cambridge; and he died, years ago, in command of the army in
  Syria. Hussein Effendi was instructed in mathematics by Ingliz Selim
  Effendi, who translated a work <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Mr. Henry Perigal helped me twenty years ago with the diagrams, direct
  from the lathe to the wood, for the article "Trochoidal Curves," in the
  <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>: these cuts add very greatly to the value of the
  article, which, indeed, could not have been made intelligible without
  them. He has had many years' experience, as an amateur turner, in
  combination of double and triple circular motions, and has published
  valuable diagrams in profusion. A person to whom the double circular
  motion is familiar in the lathe naturally looks upon one circle moving
  upon another as in <i>simple</i> motion, if the second circle be fixed to
  the revolving radius, so that one and the same point of the moving circle
  travels upon the fixed circle. Mr. Perigal commenced his attack upon the
  moon for moving about her axis, in the first of the tracts above, ten
  years before Mr. Jellinger Symons;<a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> but he did not think it necessary to
  make it a subject for the <i>Times</i> newspaper. His familiarity with
  combined motions enabled him to handle his arguments much better than Mr.
  J. Symons could do: in fact, he is the clearest assailant of the lot
  which turned out with Mr. J. Symons. But he is as wrong as the rest. The
  assault is now, I suppose, abandoned, until it becomes epidemic again.
  This it will do: it is one of those fallacies which are very tempting.
  There was a dispute on the subject in 1748, between James Ferguson<a
  name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> and an anonymous
  opponent; and I think there have been others.</p>

  <p>A poet appears in the field (July 19, 1863) who calls himself Cyclops,
  and writes four octavo pages. He makes a distinction between
  <i>rotation</i> and <i>revolution</i>; and his doctrines and phrases are
  so like those of Mr. Perigal that he is a follower at least. One of his
  arguments has so often been used that it is worth while to cite it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Would Mathematicals&mdash;forsooth&mdash;</p>
      <p>If true, have failed to prove its truth?</p>
      <p>Would not they&mdash;if they could&mdash;submit</p>
      <p>Some overwhelming proofs of it?</p>
      <p>But still it totters <i>proofless</i>! Hence</p>
      <p>There's strong presumptive evidence</p>
      <p>None do&mdash;or can&mdash;such proof profound</p>
      <p>Because <i>the dogma is unsound</i>.</p>
      <p>For, were there means of doing so,</p>
      <p>They would have proved it long ago."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is only one of the alternatives. Proof requires a person who can
  give and a person who can receive. I feel inspired to add the
  following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A blind man said, As to the Sun,</p>
      <p>I'll take my Bible oath there's none;</p>
      <p>For if there had been one to show</p>
      <p>They would have shown it long ago.</p>
      <p>How came he such a goose to be?</p>
      <p>Did he not know he couldn't see?</p>
      <p class="i16">Not he!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The absurdity of the verses is in the argument. The writer was not so
  ignorant or so dishonest as to affirm that nothing had been offered by
  the other side as proof; accordingly, his syllogism amounts to this: If
  your proposition were true, you could have given proof satisfactory to
  <i>me</i>; but this you have not done, therefore, your proposition is not
  true.</p>

  <p>The echoes of the moon-controversy reached Benares in 1857, in which
  year was there published a pamphlet "Does the Moon Rotate?" in Sanskrit
  and English. The <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>[22]</span>arguments are much the same as those of the
  discussion at home.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON THE NAMES OF RELIGIOUS BODIES.</p>

  <p>We see that there are paradoxers in argument as well as in assertion
  of fact: my plan does not bring me much into contact with these; but
  another instance may be useful. Sects, whether religious or political,
  give themselves names which, in meaning, are claimed also by their
  opponents; loyal, liberal, conservative (of good), etc. have been
  severally appropriated by parties. <i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i> are
  unobjectionable names: the first&mdash;which occurs in English ballad as
  well as in Scotland&mdash;is sour milk;<a name="NtA_45"
  href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> the second is a robber. In theology,
  the Greek Church is <i>Orthodox</i>, the Roman is <i>Catholic</i>, the
  modern Puritan is <i>Evangelical</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>The word <i>Christian</i> (Vol. I, p. 248<a name="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>) is an instance. When words begin, they
  carry their meanings. The Jews, who had their Messiah to come, and the
  followers of Jesus of Nazareth, who took <i>Him</i> for their Messiah,
  were both <i>Christians</i> (which means <i>Messianites</i>): the Jews
  would never have invented the term to signify <i>Jesuans</i>, nor would
  the disciples have invented such an ambiguous term for themselves; had
  they done so, the Jews would have disputed it, as they would have done in
  later times if they had had fair play. The Jews of our day, I see by
  their newspapers, speak of Jesus Christ as the <i>Rabbi Joshua</i>. But
  the <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>[23]</span>heathens, who knew little or nothing about
  the Jewish hope, would naturally apply the term <i>Christians</i> to the
  only followers of a <i>Messiah</i> of whom they had heard. For the
  <i>Jesuans</i> invaded them in a missionary way; while the Jews did not
  attempt, at least openly, to make proselytes.</p>

  <p>All such words as Catholic, etc., are well enough as mere
  nomenclature; and the world falls for the most part, into any names which
  parties choose to give themselves. Silly people found inferences on this
  concession; and, as usually happens, they can cite some of their betters.
  St. Augustine,<a name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> a
  freakish arguer, or, to put it in the way of an old writer, <i>lectorem
  ne multiloquii tædio fastidiat, Punicis quibusdam argutiis recreare
  solet</i>,<a name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> asks, with
  triumph, to what chapel a stranger would be directed, if he inquired the
  way to the <i>Catholic assembly</i>. But the best exhibition of this kind
  in our own century is that made by the excellent Dr. John Milner,<a
  name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> in a work (first
  published in 1801 or 1802) which I suppose still circulates, "The End of
  Religious Controversy": a startling title which, so far as its truth is
  concerned, might as well have been "The floor of the bottomless pit."
  This writer, whom every one of his readers will swear to have been a
  worthy soul, though many, even of his own sect, will not admire some of
  his logic, speaks as follows:</p>

  <p>"Letter xxv. <i>On the true Church being Catholic.</i> In treating of
  this third mark of the true Church, as expressed in our common creed, I
  feel my spirits sink within me, and I am almost tempted to throw away my
  pen in despair. For what chance is there of opening the eyes of candid
  Protestants to the other marks of the Church, if they are capable of
  keeping them shut to this? Every time they address the <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[24]</span>God of Truth,
  either in solemn worship or in private devotion [stretch of rhetoric],
  they are forced, each of them, to repeat: <i>I believe in</i> <span
  class="sc">the Catholic</span> <i>Church</i>, and yet if I ask any of
  them the question: <i>Are you a</i> <span class="sc">Catholic</span>? he
  is sure to answer me, <i>No, I am a</i> <span
  class="sc">Protestant</span>! Was there ever a more glaring instance of
  inconsistency and self-condemnation among rational beings!"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"John Milner, honest and true,</p>
      <p>Did what honest people still may do,</p>
      <p>If they write for the many and not for the few,</p>
      <p>But what by and bye they must eschew."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He <i>shortened his clause</i>; and for a reason. If he had used the
  whole epithet which he knew so well, any one might have given his
  argument a half-turn. Had he written, as he ought, "the <i>Holy</i>
  Catholic Church" and then argued as above, some sly Protestant would have
  parodied him with "and yet if I ask any of them the question: <i>Are
  you</i> <span class="scac">HOLY</span>? he is sure to answer me <i>No, I
  am a</i> <span class="scac">SINNER</span>." To take the adjective from
  the Church, and apply it to the individual partisan, is recognized
  slipslop, but not ground of argument. If Dr. M. had asked his Protestant
  whether he belonged to the Catholic <i>Church</i>, the answer would have
  been Yes, but not to the Roman branch. When he put his question as he
  did, he was rightly answered and in his own division. This leaving out
  words is a common practice, especially when the omitter is in authority,
  and cannot be exposed. A year or two ago a bishop wrote a snubbing letter
  to a poor parson, who had complained that he was obliged, in burial, to
  send the worst of sinners to everlasting happiness. The bishop sternly
  said, "<i>hope</i><a name="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> is
  not <i>assurance</i>." <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>[25]</span>Could the clergyman have dared to answer, he
  would have said, "No, my Lord! but '<i>sure and certain</i> hope' is as
  like assurance as a <i>minikin</i> man is like a dwarf." Sad to say, a
  theologian must be illogical: I feel sure that if you took the clearest
  headed writer on logic that ever lived, and made a bishop of him, he
  would be shamed by his own books in a twelvemonth.</p>

  <p>Milner's sophism is glaring: but why should Dr. Milner be wiser than
  St. Augustine, one of his teachers? I am tempted to let out the true
  derivation of the word <i>Catholic, as exclusively applied to the Church
  of Rome</i>. All can find it who have access to the <i>Rituale</i> of
  Bonaventura Piscator<a name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>
  (lib. i. c. 12, <i>de nomine Sacræ Ecclesiæ</i>, p. 87 of the Venice <!--
  Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[26]</span>folio of
  1537). I am told that there is a <i>Rituale</i> in the Index
  Expurgatorius, but I have not thought it worth while to examine whether
  this be the one: I am rather inclined to think, as I have heard
  elsewhere, that the book was held too dangerous for the faithful to know
  of it, even by a prohibition: it would not surprise me at all if Roman
  Christians should deny its existence.<a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It amuses me to give, at a great distance of time, a small Rowland for
  a small Oliver,<a name="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> which I
  received, <i>de par l'Eglise</i>,<a name="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> so far as lay in the Oliver-carrier
  more than twenty years ago. The following contribution of mine to
  <i>Notes and Queries</i> (3d Ser. vi. p. 175, Aug. 27, 1864) will explain
  what I say. There had been a complaint that a contributor had used the
  term <i>Papist</i>, which a very excellent dignitary of the Papal system
  pronounced an offensive term:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">PAPIST.</p>

  <p>The term <i>papist</i> should be stripped of all except its
  etymological meaning, and applied to those who give the higher and final
  authority to the declaration <i>ex cathedrâ</i><a name="NtA_55"
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> of the Pope. See Dr. Wiseman's<a
  name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> article, <i>Catholic
  Church</i>, in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>.</p>

  <p>What is one to do about these names? First, it is clear that offence
  should, when possible, be avoided: secondly, no one must be required to
  give a name which favors <i>any</i> assumption made by those to whom it
  is given, and not <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[27]</span>granted by those who give it. Thus the
  subdivision which calls itself distinctly <i>Evangelical</i> has no right
  to expect others to concede the title. Now the word <i>Catholic</i>, of
  course, falls under this rule; and even <i>Roman Catholic</i> may be
  refused to those who would restrict the word <i>Catholic</i> to
  themselves. <i>Roman Christian</i> is unobjectionable, since the Roman
  Church does not deny the name of Christian to those whom she calls
  heretics. No one is bound in this matter by Acts of Parliament. In many
  cases, no doubt, names which have offensive association are used merely
  by habit, sometimes by hereditary transmission. Boswell records of
  Johnson that he always used the words "dissenting teacher," refusing
  <i>minister</i> and <i>clergyman</i> to all but the recipients of
  episcopal ordination.</p>

  <p>This distinctive phrase has been widely adopted: it occurs in the
  Index of 3d S. iv. [<i>Notes and Queries</i>]. Here we find "Platts (Rev.
  John), Unitarian teacher, 412;" the article indexed has "Unitarian
  minister."</p>

  <p>This, of course is habit: an intentional refusal of the word
  <i>minister</i> would never occur in an index. I remember that, when I
  first read about Sam Johnson's little bit of exclusiveness, I said to
  myself: "Teacher? Teacher? surely I remember One who is often called
  <i>teacher</i>, but never <i>minister</i> or <i>clergyman</i>: have not
  the dissenters got the best of it?"</p>

  <p>When I said that the Roman Church concedes the epithet Christians to
  Protestants, I did not mean that all its adherents do the same. There is,
  or was, a Roman newspaper, the <i>Tablet</i>, which, seven or eight years
  ago, was one of the most virulent of the party journals. In it I read,
  referring to some complaint of grievance about mixed marriages, that if
  <i>Christians</i> would marry <i>Protestants</i> they must take the
  consequences. My memory notes this well; because I recollected, when I
  saw it, that there was in the stable a horse fit to run in the curricle
  with this one. About seventeen years ago an Oxford M.&nbsp;A., who hated <!--
  Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>[28]</span>mathematics like a genuine Oxonian of the
  last century, was writing on education, and was compelled to give some
  countenance to the nasty subject. He got out cleverly; for he gave as his
  reason for the permission, that man is an arithmetical, geometrical, and
  mechanical <i>animal</i>, as well as a rational <i>soul</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Tablet</i> was founded by an old pupil of mine, Mr. Frederic
  Lucas,<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> who availed
  himself of his knowledge of me to write some severe articles&mdash;even
  abusive, I was told, but I never saw them&mdash;against me, for
  contributing to the <i>Dublin Review</i>, and poking my heretic nose into
  orthodox places. Dr. Wiseman, the editor, came in for his share, and
  ought to have got all. Who ever blamed the pig for intruding himself into
  the cabin when the door was left open? When Mr. Lucas was my pupil, he
  was of the Society of Friends&mdash;in any article but this I should say
  <i>Quaker</i>&mdash;and was quiet and gentlemanly, as members of that
  Church&mdash;in any article but this I should, from mere habit, say
  <i>sect</i>&mdash;usually are. This is due to his memory; for, by all I
  heard, when he changed his religion he ceased to be Lucas couchant, and
  became Lucas rampant, fanged and langued gules. (I looked into Guillim<a
  name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> to see if my terms were
  right: I could not find them; but to prove I have been there, I notice
  that he calls a violin a <i>violent</i>. How comes the word to take this
  form?) I met with several Roman Christians, born and bred, who were very
  much annoyed at Mr. Lucas and his doings; and said some severe things
  about new converts needing kicking-straps.</p>

<p><!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span></p>

  <p>The mention of Dr. Wiseman reminds me of another word, appropriated by
  Christians to themselves: <i>fides</i>;<a name="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> the Roman faith is <i>fides</i>, and
  nothing else; and the adherents are <i>fideles</i>.<a name="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Hereby hangs a retort. When Dr. Wiseman
  was first in England, he gave a course of lectures in defence of his
  creed, which were thought very convincing by those who were already
  convinced. They determined to give him a medal, and there was a very
  serious discussion about the legend. Dr. Wiseman told me himself that he
  had answered to his subscribers that he would not have the medal at all
  unless&mdash;(naming some Italian authority, whom I forget) approved of
  the legend. At last <i>pro fide vindicata</i><a name="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> was chosen: this may be read either in
  a Popish or heretical sense. The feminine substantive <i>fides</i> means
  confidence, trust, (it is made to mean <i>belief</i>), but <i>fidis</i>,
  with the same ablative, <i>fide</i>, and also feminine, is a
  <i>fiddle-string</i>.<a name="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>
  If a Latin writer had had to make a legend signifying "For the defence of
  the fiddle-string," he could not have done it otherwise, in the terseness
  of a legend, than by writing <i>pro fide vindicata</i>. Accordingly, when
  a Roman Christian talks to you of the <i>faith</i>, as a thing which is
  his and not yours, you may say <i>fiddle</i>. I have searched Bonaventura
  Piscator in vain for notice of this ambiguity. But the Greeks said
  fiddle; according to Suidas,<a name="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> <span title="skindapsos" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&kappa;&iota;&nu;&delta;&alpha;&psi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span><a
  name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>&mdash;a word meaning a
  four stringed instrument played with a quill&mdash;was an exclamation of
  contemptuous dissent. How the wits of different races jump!</p>

<p><!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span></p>

  <p>I am reminded of a case of <i>fides vindicata</i>, which, being in a
  public letter, responding to a public invitation, was not meant to be
  confidential. Some of the pupils of University College, in which all
  subdivisions of religion are (1866; <i>were</i>, 1867) on a level, have
  of course changed their views in after life, and become adherents of
  various high churches. On the occasion of a dinner of old students of the
  College, convened by circular, one of these students, whether then Roman
  or Tractarian Christian I do not remember, not content with simply giving
  negative answer, or none at all, concocted a jorum of theological rebuke,
  and sent it to the Dinner Committee. Heyday! said one of them, this man
  got out of bed backwards! How is that? said the rest. Why, read his name
  backwards, and you will see. As thus read it was&mdash;<i>No grub</i>!<a
  name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE WORD CHURCH.</p>

  <p>To return to <i>Notes and Queries</i>. The substitution in the
  (editorial) index of "Unitarian teacher," for the contributor's
  "Unitarian minister," struck me very much. I have seldom found such
  things unmeaning. But as the journal had always been free from editorial
  sectarianisms,&mdash;and very apt to check the contributorial,&mdash;I
  could not be sure in this case. True it was, that the editor and
  publisher had been changed more than a year before; but this was not of
  much force. Though one swallow does not make a summer, I have generally
  found it show that summer is coming. However, thought I to myself, if
  this be Little Shibboleth, we shall have Big Shibboleth by-and-bye. At
  last it came. About a twelvemonth afterwards, (3d S. vii. p. 36) the
  following was the <i>editorial</i> answer to the question when the
  establishment was first called the "Church of England and Ireland":</p>

<p><!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>[31]</span></p>

  <p>"That unmeaning clause, 'The United Church of England and Ireland,'
  which occurs on the title-page of <i>The Book of Common Prayer</i>, was
  first used at the commencement of the present century. The authority for
  this phrase is the fifth article of the Union of 1800: 'That the Churches
  of England and Ireland be united into one <i>Protestant</i> (!) episcopal
  Church, to be called "The United Church of England and Ireland."' Of
  course, churchmen are not responsible for the theology of Acts of
  Parliament, especially those passed during the dark ages of the Georgian
  era."</p>

  <p>That is to say, the journal gives its adhesion to the party
  which&mdash;under the assumed title of <i>the</i> Church of
  England&mdash;claims for the endowed corporation for the support of
  religion rights which Parliament cannot control, and makes it, in fact, a
  power above the State. The State has given an inch: it calls this
  corporation by the name of the "United <i>Church</i> of England and
  Ireland," as if neither England nor Ireland had any other Church. The
  corporation, accordingly aspires to an ell. But this the nation will only
  give with the aspiration prefixed. To illustrate my allusion in a
  delicate way to polite ears, I will relate what happened in a Johnian
  lecture-room at Cambridge, some fifty years ago, my informant being
  present. A youth of undue aspirations was giving a proposition, and at
  last said, "Let E F be produced to 'L':" "Not quite so far, Mr.
  &mdash;&mdash;," said the lecturer, quietly, to the great amusement of
  the class, and the utter astonishment of the aspirant, who knew no more
  than a Tractarian the tendency of his construction.</p>

  <p>This word <i>Church</i> is made to have a very mystical meaning. The
  following dialogue between Ecclesiastes and Hæreticus, which I cannot
  vouch for, has often taken place in spirit, if not in letter: E. The word
  <i>Church</i> (<span title="ekklêsia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;</span>)<a
  name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> is never used in the New
  Testament except generally or locally for that holy and mystical body to
  which the sacraments and the ordinances of Christianity are entrusted.
  <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span>H.
  Indeed! E. It is beyond a doubt (here he quoted half a dozen texts in
  support). H. Do you mean that any doctrine or ordinance which was
  solemnly practised by the <span title="ekklêsia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;</span> is
  binding upon you and me? E. Certainly, unless we should be cut off from
  the congregation of the faithful. H. Have you a couple of hours to spare?
  E. What for? H. If you have, I propose we spend them in crying, Great is
  Diana of the Ephesians! E. What do you mean? H. You ought to know the
  solemn service of the <span title="ekklêsia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;</span> (Acts
  xix. 32, 41), at Ephesus; which any one might take to be true Church, by
  the more part not knowing wherefore they were come together, and which
  was dismissed, after one of the most sensible sermons ever preached, by
  the Recorder. E. I see your meaning: it is true, there is that one
  exception! H. Why, the Recorder's sermon itself contains another, the
  <span title="ennomos ekklêsia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F10;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;</span>,<a
  name="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> legislative assembly. E.
  Ah! the New Testament can only be interpreted by the Church! H. I see!
  the Church interprets itself into existence out of the New Testament, and
  then interprets the New Testament out of existence into itself!</p>

  <p>I look upon all the Churches as fair game which declare of me that
  <i>absque dubio in æternum peribo</i>;<a name="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> not for their presumption towards God,
  but for their personal insolence towards myself. I find that their
  sectaries stare when I say this. Why! they do not speak of you in
  <i>particular</i>! These poor reasoners seem to think that there could be
  no meaning, as against me, unless it should be propounded that "without
  doubt he shall perish everlastingly, especially A. De Morgan." But I
  hold, with the schoolmen, that "<i>Omnis</i> homo est animal" in
  conjunction with "Sortes est homo" amounts to "<i>Sortes</i> est
  animal."<a name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> But they do
  not mean it <i>personally</i>! Every universal proposition is <!-- Page
  33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[33]</span>personal to
  every instance of the subject. If this be not conceded, then I retort, in
  their own sense and manner, "Whosoever would serve God, before all things
  he must not pronounce God's decision upon his neighbor. Which decision,
  except every one leave to God himself, without doubt he is a bigoted
  noodle."</p>

  <p>The reasoning habit of the educated community, in four cases out of
  five, permits universal propositions to be stated at one time, and
  denied, <i>pro re nata</i>,<a name="NtA_70"
  href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> at another. "Before we proceed to
  consider any question involving physical principles, we should set out
  with <i>clear ideas</i> of the naturally possible and impossible." The
  eminent man who said this, when wanting it for his views of mental
  education (!) never meant it for more than what was in hand, never
  assumed it in the researches which will give him to posterity! I have
  heard half-a-dozen defences of his having said this, not one of which
  affirmed the truth of what was said. A worthy clergyman wrote that if
  A.&nbsp;B. had said a certain thing the point in question would have been
  established. It was shown to him that A.&nbsp;B. <i>had</i> said it, to which
  the reply was a refusal to admit the point because A.&nbsp;B. said it in a
  second pamphlet and in answer to objections. And I might give fifty such
  instances with very little search. Always assume more than you want;
  because you cannot tell how much you may want: put what is over into the
  didn't-mean-that basket, or the extreme case what-not.</p>

<p class="cenhead">PROTESTANT AND PAPAL CHRISTENDOM.</p>

  <p>Something near forty years of examination of the theologies on and
  off&mdash;more years very much on than quite off&mdash;have given me a
  good title&mdash;to myself, I ask no one else for leave&mdash;to make the
  following remarks: A conclusion has <i>premises</i>, facts or doctrines
  from proof or authority, and <i>mode of inference</i>. There may be
  invention or <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span>falsehood of premise, with good logic; and
  there may be tenable premise, followed by bad logic; and there may be
  both false premise <i>and</i> bad logic. The Roman system has such a
  powerful manufactory of premises, that bad logic is little wanted; there
  is comparatively little of it. The doctrine-forge of the Roman Church is
  one glorious compound of everything that could make Heraclitus<a
  name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> sob and Democritus<a
  name="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> snigger. But not the only
  one. The Protestants, in tearing away from the Church of Rome, took with
  them a fair quantity of the results of the Roman forge, which they could
  not bring themselves to give up. They had more in them of Martin than of
  Jack. But they would have no premises, except from the New Testament;
  though some eked out with a few general Councils. The consequence is that
  they have been obliged to find such a logic as would bring the
  conclusions they require out of the canonical books. And a queer logic it
  is; nothing but the Roman forge can be compared with the Protestant loom.
  The picking, the patching, the piecing, which goes to the Protestant
  <i>termini ad quem</i>,<a name="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>
  would be as remarkable to the general eye, as the Roman manufacture of
  <i>termini a quo</i>,<a name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>
  if it were not that the world at large seizes the character of an
  asserted fact better than that of a mode of inference. A grand step
  towards the deification of a lady, made by alleged revelation 1800 years
  after her death, is of glaring evidence: two or three additional
  shiffle-shuffles towards defence of saying the Athanasian curse in church
  and unsaying it out of church, are hardly noticed. Swift has bungled his
  satire where he makes Peter a party to finding out what he wants,
  <i>totidem syllabis</i> and <i>totidem literis</i>, <!-- Page 35 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[35]</span>when he cannot find it
  <i>totidem verbis</i><a name="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
  This is Protestant method: the Roman plan is <i>viam faciam</i>; the
  Protestant plan is <i>viam inveniam</i>.<a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> The public at large begins to be
  conversant with the ways of <i>wriggling out</i>, as shown in the
  interpretations of the damnatory parts of the Athanasian Creed, the
  phrases of the Burial Service, etc. The time will come when the same
  public will begin to see the ways of <i>wriggling in</i>. But one thing
  at a time: neither Papal Rome nor Protestant Rome was built&mdash;nor
  will be pulled down&mdash;in a day.</p>

  <p>The distinction above drawn between the two great antitheses of
  Christendom may be illustrated as follows. Two sets of little general
  dealers lived opposite to one another: all sold milk. Each vaunted its
  own produce: one set said that the stuff on the other side the way was
  only chalk and water; the other said that the opposites sold all sorts of
  filth, of which calves' brain was the least nasty. Now the fact was that
  both sets sold milk, and from the same dairy: but adulterated with
  different sorts of dirty water: and both honestly believed that the
  mixture was what they were meant to sell and ought to sell. The great
  difference between them, about which the apprentices fought each other
  like Trojans, was that the calves' brain men poured milk into the water,
  and the chalk men poured water into the milk. The Greek and Roman sects
  on one side, the Protestant sects on the other, must all have
  <i>churches</i>: the Greek and Roman sects pour the New Testament into
  their churches; the Protestant sects pour their churches into the New
  Testament. The Greek and Roman insist upon the New Testament being no
  more than part and parcel of their churches: the Protestant insist upon
  their churches being as much part and parcel of the New Testament. All
  dwell vehemently upon the doctrine that there must be milk <!-- Page 36
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[36]</span>somewhere; and
  each says&mdash;I have it. The doctrine is true: and can be verified by
  any one who can and will go to the dairy for himself. Him will the
  several traders declare to have no milk at all. They will bring their own
  wares, and challenge a trial: they want nothing but to name the judges.
  To vary the metaphor, those who have looked at Christianity in open day,
  know that all who see it through painted windows shut out much of the
  light of heaven and color the rest; it matters nothing that the stains
  are shaped into what are meant for saints and angels.</p>

  <p>But there is another side to the question. To decompose any substance,
  it must be placed between the poles of the battery. Now theology is but
  one pole; philosophy is the other. No one can make out the combinations
  of our day unless he read the writings both of the priest and the
  philosopher: and if any one should hold the first word offensive, I tell
  him that I mean <i>both</i> words to be <i>significant</i>. In reading
  these writings, he will need to bring both wires together to find out
  what it is all about. Time was when most priests were very explicit about
  the fate of philosophers, and most philosophers were very candid about
  their opinion of priests. But though some extremes of the old sorts still
  remain, there is now, in the middle, such a fusion of the two pursuits
  that a plain man is wofully puzzled. The theologian writes a philosophy
  which seems to tell us that the New Testament is a system of psychology;
  and the philosopher writes a Christianity which is utterly unintelligible
  as to the question whether the Resurrection be a fact or a transcendental
  allegory. What between the theologian who assents to the Athanasian
  denunciation in what seems the sense of no denunciation, and the
  philosopher who parades a Christianity which looks like no revelation,
  there is a maze which threatens to have the only possible clue in the
  theory that everything is something else, and nothing is anything at all.
  But this is a paradox far beyond my handling: it is a Budget of itself.

<p class="cenhead">RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY.</p>

  <p>Religion and Philosophy, the two best gifts of Heaven, set up in
  opposition to each other at the revival of letters; and never did
  competing tradesmen more grossly misbehave. Bad wishes and bad names flew
  about like swarms of wasps. The Athanasian curses were intended against
  philosophers; who, had they been a corporation, with state powers to
  protect them, would have formulized a <i>per contra</i>. But the
  tradesmen are beginning to combine: they are civil to each other; too
  civil by half. I speak especially of Great Britain. Old theology has run
  off to ritualism, much lamenting, with no comfort except the discovery
  that the cloak Paul left at Troas was a chasuble. Philosophy, which
  always had a little sense sewed up in its garments&mdash;to pay for its
  funeral?&mdash;has expended a trifle in accommodating itself to the new
  system. But the two are poles of a battery; and a question arises.</p>

      <p>Where is the peck of pepper Peter Piper picked?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If Religion and Philosophy be the two poles of a battery, whose is the
  battery Religion and Philosophy have been made the poles of? Is the
  change in the relation of the wires any presumption of a removal of the
  managers? We know pretty well who handled the instrument: has he resigned
  or been<a name="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> turned out? Has
  he been put under <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>[38]</span>restriction? A fool may ask more questions
  than twenty sages can answer: but there is hope; for twenty sages cannot
  ask more questions than one reviewer can answer. I should like to see the
  opposite sides employed upon the question, What are the <i>commoda</i>,
  and what the <i>pericula</i>,<a name="NtA_78"
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> of the current approximation of
  Religion and Philosophy?</p>

  <p>All this is very profane and irreverent! It has always been so held by
  those whose position demands such holding. To describe the Church as it
  is passes for assailing the Church as it ought to be with all who cannot
  do without it. In Bedlam<a name="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> a poor creature who fancied he was St.
  Paul, was told by another patient that he was an impostor; the first
  maniac lodged a complaint against the second for calling St. Paul an
  impostor, which, he argued, with much appearance of sanity, ought not to
  be permitted in a well regulated madhouse. Nothing could persuade him
  that he had missed the question, which was whether <i>he</i> was St.
  Paul. The same thing takes place in the world <i>at large</i>. And
  especially must be noted the refusal to permit to the <i>profane</i> the
  millionth part of the licence assumed by the <i>sacred</i>. I give a
  sound churchman the epitaph of St. John Long; the usual pronunciation of
  whose name must be noted&mdash;</p>

  earnest&mdash;unless you quibble&mdash;to all the millions of the Greek
  Church, and a great many others. Enough of you and your reasoning! Go and
  square the circle!</p>

  <p>The few years which end with 1867 have shown, not merely the
  intermediate fusion of Theology and Philosophy of which I have spoken,
  but much concentration of the two extremes, which looks like a gathering
  of forces for some very hard fought Armageddon. Extreme theology has been
  aiming at a high Church in England, which is to show a new front to all
  heresy: and extreme philosophy is contriving a physical organization
  which is to <i>think</i>, and to show that mind is a consequence of
  matter, or thought a recreation of brain. The physical speculators begin
  with a possible hypothesis, in which they aim at explanation: and so the
  bold aspirations of the author of the <i>Vestiges</i> find
  standing-ground in the variation of species by "natural selection." Some
  relics&mdash;so supposed&mdash;of extremely ancient men are brought to
  help the general cause. Only distant hints are given that by possibility
  it may end in the formation of all living organisms from a very few, if
  not from one. The better heads above mentioned know that their theory, if
  true, does not bear upon morals. The formation of solar systems from a
  nebular hypothesis, followed by organizations gradually emerging from
  some curious play of particles, nay, the very evolution of mind and
  thought from such an apparatus, are all as consistent with a Personal
  creative power to whom homage and obedience are due, and who has declared
  himself, as with a blind Nature of Things. A pure materialist, as to all
  things visible, may be even a bigotted Christian: this is not frequent,
  but it is possible. There is a proverb which says, A pig may fly, but it
  isn't a likely bird. But when the psychological speculator comes in, he
  often undertakes to draw inferences from the physical conclusions, by
  joining on his tremendous apparatus of <i>a priori</i> knowledge. He
  deduces that he can <i>do without</i> a God: he can deduce all things
  <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>[40]</span>without any such necessity. With Occam<a
  name="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and Newton he will have
  no more causes than are necessary to explain phenomena <i>to him</i>: and
  if by pure head-work combined with results of physical observation he can
  construct his universe, he must be a very <i>unphilosophical</i> man who
  would encumber himself with a useless Creator! There is something
  tangible about my method, says he; yours is vague. He requires it to be
  granted that his system is <i>positive</i> and that yours is
  <i>impositive</i>. So reasoned the stage coachman when the railroads
  began to depose him&mdash;"If you're upset in a stage-coach, why, there
  you are! but if you're upset on the railroad, where are you?" The answer
  lies in another question, Which is most positive knowledge, God deduced
  from man and his history, or the postulates of the few who think they can
  reason <i>a priori</i> on the tacit assumption of unlimited command of
  data?</p>

  <p>We are not yet come to the existence of a school of philosophers who
  explicitly deny a Creator: but we are on the way, though common sense may
  interpose. There are always straws which show the direction of the wind.
  I have before me the printed letter of a medical man&mdash;to whose
  professional ability I have good testimony&mdash;who finds the vital
  principle in highly rarefied oxygen. With the usual logic of such
  thinkers, he dismisses the "eternal personal identity" because "If soul,
  spirit, mind, which are merely modes of sensation, be the attribute or
  function of nerve-tissue, it cannot possibly have any existence apart
  from its material organism!" How does he know this <i>impossibility</i>?
  If all the mind <i>we</i> know be from nerve-tissue, how does it appear
  that mind in other planets may not be another thing? Nay, when we come to
  <i>possibilities</i>, does not his own system give a queer one? If highly
  rarefied oxygen be vital power, more highly rarefied oxygen <!-- Page 41
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[41]</span>may be more
  vital and more powerful. Where is this to stop? Is it <i>impossible</i>
  that a finite quantity, rarefied <i>ad infinitum</i>, may be an
  Omnipotent? Perhaps the true Genesis, when written, will open with "In
  the beginning was an imperial quart of oxygen at 60° of Fahrenheit, and
  the pressure of the atmosphere; and this oxygen was infinitely rarefied;
  and this oxygen became God." For myself, my aspirations as to this system
  are Manichæan. The quart of oxygen is the Ormuzd, or good principle:
  another quart, of hydrogen, is the Ahriman, or evil principle! My author
  says that his system explains Freewill and Immortality so obviously that
  it is difficult to read previous speculations with becoming gravity. My
  deduction explains the conflict of good and evil with such clearness that
  no one can henceforward read the New Testament with becoming reverence.
  The surgeon whom I have described is an early bud which will probably be
  nipped by the frost and wither on the ground: but there is a good crop
  coming. Material pneuma is destined to high functions; and man is to read
  by gas-light.</p>

  <p>1849. <i>Joseph Ady</i><a name="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> is entitled to a place in this list of
  discoverers: his great fault, like that of some others, lay in pushing
  his method too far. He began by detecting unclaimed dividends, and
  disclosing them to their right owners, exacting his fee before he made
  his communication. He then generalized into trying to get fees from all
  of the <i>name</i> belonging to a dividend; and he gave mysterious hints
  of danger impending. For instance, he would write to a clergyman that a
  legal penalty was hanging over him; and when the alarmed divine forwarded
  the sum required for disclosure, he was favored with an extract from some
  old statute or canon, never repealed, forbidding a clergyman to be a
  member of a corporation, and was reminded that he had insured his life in
  the &mdash;&mdash; Office, which had a royal charter. He was facetious,
  was Joseph: he described himself in his circulars as "personally known to
  Sir Peter Laurie<a name="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> and
  all other aldermen"; which was nearly true, <!-- Page 43 --><span

  most of them on charges of false pretence; but I believe he was nearly
  always within the law. Sir James Duke, when Lord Mayor, having
  particularly displeased him by a decision, his circulars of 1849 contain
  the following:</p>

  <p>"Should you have cause to complain of any party, Sir J. Duke has
  contrived a new law of evidence, viz., write to him, he will consider
  your letter sufficient proof, and make the parties complained of pay
  without judge or jury, and will frank you from every expense."</p>

  <p>I strongly suspect that Joseph Ady believed in himself.</p>

  <p>He sometimes issued a second warning, of a Sibylline character:</p>

  <p>"Should you find cause to complain of anybody, my voluntary referee,
  the Rt. Hon. Sir Peter Laurie, Kt., perpetual Deputy Lord Mayor, will see
  justice done you without any charge whatever: he and his toady, &mdash;

  <p>Lieut. Morrison is Zadkiel Tao Sze, and declares himself in real
  earnest an astrologer. There are a great many books on astrology, but I
  have not felt interest enough to preserve many of them which have come in
  my way. If anything ever had a fair trial, it was astrology. The idea
  itself is natural enough. A human being, set down on this earth, without
  any tradition, would probably suspect that the heavenly bodies had
  something to do with the guidance of affairs. I think that any one who
  tries will ascertain that the planets do not prophesy: but if he should
  find to the contrary, he will of course go on asking. A great many
  persons class together belief in astrology and belief in apparitions: the
  two things differ in precisely the way in which a science of observation
  differs from a science of experiment. Many make the mistake which M. le
  Marquis made when he came too late, and hoped M. Cassini<a name="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> would do the eclipse over again for his
  ladies. The apparition chooses its own time, and comes as seldom or as
  often as it pleases, be it departed spirit, nervous derangement, or
  imposition. Consequently it can only be observed, and not experimented
  upon. But the heavens, if astrology be true, are prophesying away day and
  night all the year round, and about every body. Experiments can be made,
  then, except only on rare phenomena, such as eclipses: anybody may choose
  his time and his question. This is the great difference: and experiments
  were made, century after century. If astrology had been true, it must
  have lasted in an ever-improving state. If it be true, it is a truth, and
  a useful truth, which had experience and prejudice both in its favor, and
  yet lost ground as soon as astronomy, its working tool, began to
  improve.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>1850. A letter in the handwriting of an educated man, dated from a
  street in which it must be taken that educated persons live, is addressed
  to the Secretary of the <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>[45]</span>Astronomical Society about a matter on which
  the writer says "his professional pursuit will enable him to give a
  satisfactory reply." In a question before a court of law it is sworn on
  one side that the moon was shining at a certain hour of a certain night
  on a certain spot in London; on the other side it is affirmed that she
  was clouded. The Secretary is requested to decide. This is curious, as
  the question is not astrological. Persons still send to Greenwich, now
  and then, to have their fortunes told. In one case, not very many years
  ago, a young gentleman begged to know who his wife was to be, and what
  fee he was to remit.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the astronomer turns conjurer for fun, and his prophesies
  are fulfilled. It is related of Flamsteed<a name="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> that an old woman came to know the
  whereabouts of a bundle of linen which had strayed. Flamsteed drew a
  circle, put a square into it, and gravely pointed out a ditch, near her
  cottage, in which he said it would be found. He meant to have given the
  woman a little good advice when she came back: but she came back in great
  delight, with the bundle in her hand, found in the very place. The late
  Baron Zach<a name="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> received a
  letter from Pons,<a name="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> a
  successful finder of comets, complaining that for a certain period he had
  found no comets, though he had searched diligently. Zach, a man of much
  sly humor, told him that no spots had been seen on the sun for about the
  same time&mdash;which was true,&mdash;and assured him that when the spots
  came back, the comets would come with them. Some time after he got a
  letter <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>[46]</span>from Pons, who informed him with great
  satisfaction that he was quite right, that very large spots had appeared
  on the sun, and that he had found a fine comet shortly after. I do not
  vouch for the first story, but I have the second in Zach's handwriting.
  It would mend the joke exceedingly if some day a real relation should be
  established between comets and solar spots: of late years good reason has
  been shown for advancing a connection between these spots and the earth's
  magnetism.<a name="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> If the two
  things had been put to Zach, he would probably have chosen the comets.
  Here is a hint for a paradox: the solar spots are the dead comets, which
  have parted with their light and heat to feed the sun, as was once
  suggested. I should not wonder if I were too late, and the thing had been
  actually maintained. My list does not contain the twentieth part of the
  possible whole.</p>

  <p>The mention of coincidences suggests an everlasting source of
  explanations, applicable to all that is extraordinary. The great paradox
  of coincidence is that of Leibnitz, known as the <i>pre-established
  harmony</i>, or <i>law of coincidences</i>, by which, separately and
  independently, the body receives impressions, and the mind proceeds as if
  it had perceived them from without. Every sensation, and the consequent
  state of the soul, are independent things coincident in time by the
  pre-established law. The philosopher could not otherwise <i>account
  for</i> the connection of mind and matter; and he never goes by so vulgar
  a rule as <i>Whatever is, is</i>; to him that which is not clear as to
  how, is not at all. Philosophers in general, who tolerate each other's
  theories much better than Christians do each other's failings, seldom
  revive Leibnitz's fantasy: they seem to act upon the maxim quoted by
  Father Eustace<a name="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> from the
  <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>[47]</span>Decretals, <i>Facinora ostendi dum
  puniuntur, flagitia autem abscondi debent</i>.<a name="NtA_92"
  href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The great <i>ghost-paradox</i>, and its theory of <i>coincidences</i>,
  will rise to the surface in the mind of every one. But the use of the
  word <i>coincidence</i> is here at variance with its common meaning. When
  A is constantly happening, and also B, the occurrence of A and B at the
  same moment is the mere coincidence which may be casualty. But the case
  before us is that A is constantly happening, while B, when it does
  happen, almost always happens with A, and very rarely without it. That is
  to say, such is the phenomenon asserted: and all who rationally refer it
  to casualty, affirm that B is happening very often as well as A, but that
  it is not thought worthy of being recorded except when A is simultaneous.
  Of course A is here a death, and B the spectral appearance of the person
  who dies. In talking of this subject it is necessary to put out of the
  question all who play fast and loose with their secret convictions: these
  had better give us a reason, when they feel internal pressure for
  explanation, that there is no weathercock at Kilve; this would do for all
  cases. But persons of real inquiry will see that first, experience does
  not bear out the asserted frequency of the spectre, without the alleged
  coincidence of death: and secondly, that if the crowd of purely casual
  spectres were so great that it is no wonder that, now and then the person
  should have died at or near the moment, we ought to expect a much larger
  proportion of cases in which the spectre should come at the moment of the
  death of one or another of all the cluster who are closely connected with
  the original of the spectre. But this, we know, is almost without
  example. It remains then, for all, who speculate at all, to look upon the
  asserted phenomenon, think what they may of it, the thing which is to be
  explained, as a <i>connection</i> in time of the death, and the <!-- Page
  48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[48]</span>simultaneous
  appearance of the dead. Any person the least used to the theory of
  probabilities will see that purely casual coincidence, the <i>wrong
  spectre</i> being comparatively so rare that it may be said never to
  occur, is not within the rational field of possibility.</p>

  <p>The purely casual coincidence, from which there is no escape except
  the actual doctrine of special providences, carried down to a very low
  point of special intention, requires a junction of the things the like of
  each of which is always happening. I will give three instances which have
  occurred to myself within the last few years: I solemnly vouch for the
  literal truth of every part of all three:</p>

  <p>In August 1861, M. Senarmont,<a name="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> of the French Institute, wrote to me to
  the effect that Fresnel<a name="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>
  had sent to England, in or shortly after 1824, a paper for translation
  and insertion in the <i>European Review</i>, which shortly afterwards
  expired. The question was what had become of that paper. I examined the
  <i>Review</i> at the Museum, found no trace of the paper, and wrote back
  to that effect at the Museum, adding that everything now depended on
  ascertaining the name of the editor, and tracing his papers: of this I
  thought there was no chance. I posted this letter on my way home, at a
  Post Office in the Hampstead Road at the junction with Edward Street, on
  the opposite side of which is a bookstall. Lounging for a moment over the
  exposed books, <i>sicut meus est mos</i>,<a name="NtA_95"
  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> I saw, within a few minutes of the
  posting of the letter, a little catch-penny book of anecdotes of
  Macaulay, which I bought, and ran over for a minute. My eye was soon
  caught by this sentence: "One of the young fellows immediately wrote to
  the editor (Mr. Walker) <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>[49]</span>of the <i>European Review</i>." I thus got
  the clue by which I ascertained that there was no chance of recovering
  Fresnel's paper. Of the mention of current reviews, not one in a thousand
  names the editor.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 1865 I made my first acquaintance with the tales of
  Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the first I read was about the siege of Boston
  in the War of Independence. I could not make it out: everybody seemed to
  have got into somebody else's place. I was beginning the second tale,
  when a parcel arrived: it was a lot of old pamphlets and other rubbish,
  as he called it, sent by a friend who had lately sold his books, had not
  thought it worth while to send these things for sale, but thought I might
  like to look at them and possibly keep some. The first thing I looked at
  was a sheet which, being opened, displayed "A plan of Boston and its
  environs, shewing the true situation of his Majesty's army and also that
  of the rebels, drawn by an engineer, at Boston Oct. 1775." Such detailed
  plans of current sieges being then uncommon, it is explained that "The
  principal part of this plan was surveyed by Richard Williams, Lieutenant
  at Boston; and sent over by the son of a nobleman to his father in town,
  by whose permission it was published." I immediately saw that my
  confusion arose from my supposing that the king's troops were besieging
  the rebels, when it was just the other way.</p>

  <p>April 1, 1853, while engaged in making some notes on a logical point,
  an idea occurred which was perfectly new to me, on the mode of
  conciliating the notions <i>omnipresence</i> and <i>indivisibility into
  parts</i>. What it was is no matter here: suffice it that, since it was
  published elsewhere (in a paper on <i>Infinity</i>, <i>Camb. Phil.
  Trans.</i> vol. xi. p. 1) I have not had it produced to me. I had just
  finished a paragraph on the subject, when a parcel came in from a
  bookseller containing Heywood's<a name="NtA_96"
  href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> <i>Analysis of Kant's Critick</i>,
  1844.</p>

<p><!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span></p>

  <p>On turning over the leaves I found (p. 109) the identical thought
  which up to this day, I only know as in my own paper, or in Kant. I feel
  sure I had not seen it before, for it is in Kant's first edition, which
  was never translated to my knowledge; and it does not appear in the later
  editions. Mr. Heywood gives some account of the first edition.</p>

  <p>In the broadsheet which gave account of the dying scene of Charles II,
  it is said that the Roman Catholic priest was introduced by
  P.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;F. The chain was this: the Duchess of Portsmouth<a
  name="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> applied to the Duke of
  York, who may have consulted his Cordelier confessor, Mansuete, about
  procuring a priest, and the priest was smuggled into the king's room by
  the Duchess and Chiffinch.<a name="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> Now the letters are a verbal acrostic
  of <i>Père Mansuete a Cordelier Friar</i>, and a syllabic acrostic of
  <i>PortsMouth and ChifFinch</i>. This is a singular coincidence. Macaulay
  adopted the first interpretation, preferring it to the second, which I
  brought before him as the conjecture of a near relative of my own. But
  Mansuete is not mentioned in his narrative: it may well be doubted
  whether the writer of a broadside for English readers would use
  <i>Père</i> instead of <i>Father</i>. And the person who really
  "reminded" the Duke of "the duty he owed to his brother," was the Duchess
  and not Mansuete. But my affair is only with the coincidence.</p>

  <p>But there are coincidences which are really connected without the
  connection being known to those who find in them matter of astonishment.
  Presentiments furnish marked cases: sometimes there is no mystery to
  those who have the clue. In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (vol. 80,
  part 2, p. 33) we read, the subject being presentiment of death, as
  follows: "In 1778, to come nearer the recollection of <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[51]</span>survivors, at
  the taking of Pondicherry, Captain John Fletcher, Captain De Morgan, and
  Lieutenant Bosanquet, each distinctly foretold his own death on the
  morning of his fate." I have no doubt of all three; and I knew it of my
  grandfather long before I read the above passage. He saw that the battery
  he commanded was unduly exposed: I think by the sap running through the
  fort when produced. He represented this to the engineer officers, and to
  the commander-in-chief; the engineers denied the truth of the statement,
  the commander believed them, my grandfather quietly observed that he must
  make his will, and the French fulfilled his prediction. His will bore
  date the day of his death; and I always thought it more remarkable than
  the fulfilment of the prophecy that a soldier should not consider any
  danger short of one like the above, sufficient reason to make his will. I
  suppose the other officers were similarly posted. I am told that military
  men very often defer making their wills until just before an action: but
  to face the ordinary risks intestate, and to wait until speedy death must
  be the all but certain consequence of a stupid mistake, is carrying the
  principle very far. In the matter of coincidences there are, as in other
  cases, two wonderful extremes with every intermediate degree. At one end
  we have the confident people who can attribute anything to casual
  coincidence; who allow Zadok Imposture and Nathan Coincidence to anoint
  Solomon Selfconceit king. At the other end we have those who see
  something <i>very curious</i> in any coincidence you please, and whose
  minds yearn for a deep reason. A speculator of this class happened to
  find that Matthew viii. 28-33 and Luke viii. 26-33 contain the same
  account, that of the demons entering into the swine. Very odd! chapters
  tallying, and verses so nearly: is the versification rightly managed?
  Examination is sure to show that there are monstrous inconsistencies in
  the mode of division, which being corrected, the verses tally as well as
  the chapters. And then how comes it? I cannot go on, <!-- Page 52
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span>for I have no
  gift at torturing a coincidence, but I would lay twopence, if I could
  make a bet&mdash;which I never did in all my life&mdash;that some one or
  more of my readers will try it. Some people say that the study of chances
  tends to awaken a spirit of gambling: I suspect the contrary. At any
  rate, I myself, the writer of a mathematical book and a comparatively
  popular book, have never laid a bet nor played for a stake, however
  small: not one single time.</p>

  <p>It is useful to record such instances as I have given, with precision
  and on the solemn word of the recorder. When such a story as that of
  Flamsteed is told, <i>a priori</i> assures us that it could not have
  been: the story may have been a <i>ben trovato</i>,<a name="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> but not the bundle. It is also useful
  to establish some of the good jokes which all take for inventions. My
  friend Mr. J. Bellingham Inglis,<a name="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> before 1800, saw the tobacconist's
  carriage with a sample of tobacco in a shield, and the motto <i>Quid
  rides</i><a name="NtA_101" href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> (<i>N.</i>
  &amp; <i>Q.</i>, 3d S. i. 245). His father was able to tell him all about
  it. The tobacconist was Jacob Brandon, well known to the elder Mr.
  Inglis, and the person who started the motto, the instant he was asked
  for such a thing, was Harry Calender of Lloyd's, a scholar and a wit. My
  friend Mr. H. Crabb Robinson<a name="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> remembers the King's Counsel (Samuel
  Marryat) who took the motto <i>Causes produce effects</i>, when his
  success enabled him to start a carriage.</p>

  <p>The coincidences of errata are sometimes very remarkable: it may be
  that the misprint has a sting. The death of Sir W. Hamilton<a
  name="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> of Edinburgh was known
  in London on a Thursday, and the editor of the <i>Athenæum</i> wrote to
  <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span>me
  in the afternoon for a short obituary notice to appear on Saturday. I
  dashed off the few lines which appeared without a moment to think: and
  those of my readers who might perhaps think me capable of contriving
  errata with meaning will, I am sure, allow the hurry, the occasion, and
  my own peculiar relation to the departed, as sufficient reasons for
  believing in my entire innocence. Of course I could not see a proof: and
  two errata occurred. The words "addition to Stewart"<a name="NtA_104"
  href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> require "<i>for</i> addition to
  <i>read</i> edition of." This represents what had been insisted on by the
  Edinburgh publisher, who, frightened by the edition of Reid,<a
  name="NtA_105" href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> had stipulated for a
  simple reprint without notes. Again "principles of logic and mathematics"
  required "<i>for</i> mathematics <i>read</i> metaphysics." No four words
  could be put together which would have so good a title to be Hamilton's
  motto.</p>

  <p>April 1850, found in the letter-box, three loose leaves, well printed
  and over punctuated, being</p>

  <p>A very large collection might be made of such apostolic writings. They
  go on well enough in a misty&mdash;meant for mystical&mdash;imitation of
  St. Paul or the prophets, until at last some prodigious want of keeping
  shows the education of the writer. For example, after half a page which
  might <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  whom it was presented as such would say that most likely the head and
  tail would make something more like head and tail of it&mdash;we are
  astounded by a declaration from the <i>Holy Spirit</i>, speaking of
  himself, that he is "not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ." It would be
  long before we should find in <i>educated</i> rhapsody&mdash;of which
  there are specimens enough&mdash;such a thing as a person of the Trinity
  taking merit for moral courage enough to stand where St. Peter fell. The
  following declaration comes next&mdash;"I will judge between cattle and
  cattle, that use their tongues."</p>

  <p>I have several books on that great paradox of our day,
  <i>Spiritualism</i>, but I shall exclude all but three. The bibliography
  of this subject is now very large. The question is one both of evidence
  and speculation;&mdash;Are the facts <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span>true? Are they caused by
  spirits? These I shall not enter upon: I shall merely recommend this work
  as that of a spiritualist who does not enter on the subject, which he
  takes for granted, but applies his derived views to the history of
  mankind with learning and thought. Mr. Smith was a man of a very peculiar
  turn of thinking. He was, when alive, the editor, or <i>an</i> editor, of
  the <i>Family Herald</i>: I say when alive, to speak according to
  knowledge; for, if his own views be true, he may have a hand in it still.
  The answers to correspondents, in his time, were piquant and original
  above any I ever saw. I think a very readable book might be made out of
  them, resembling "Guesses at Truth:" the turn given to an inquiry about
  morals, religion, or socials, is often of the highest degree of
  <i>unexpectedness</i>; the poor querist would find himself right in a
  most unpalatable way.</p>

  <p>Answers to correspondents, in newspapers, are very often the fag ends
  of literature. I shall never forget the following. A person was invited
  to name a rule without exception, if he could: he answered "A man
  <i>must</i> be present when he is shaved." A lady&mdash;what right have
  ladies to decide questions about shaving?&mdash;said this was not
  properly a rule; and the oracle was consulted. The editor agreed with the
  lady; he said that "a man <i>must</i> be present when he is shaved" is
  not a <i>rule</i>, but a <i>fact</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>[Among my anonymous communicants is one who states that I have done
  injustice to the Rev. James Smith in "referring to him as a
  spiritualist," and placing his "Divine Drama" among paradoxes: "it is no
  paradox, nor do <i>spiritualistic</i> views mar or weaken the execution
  of the design." Quite true: for the design is to produce and enforce
  "spiritualistic views"; and leather does not mar nor weaken a shoemaker's
  plan. I knew Mr. Smith well, and have often talked to him on the subject:
  but more testimony from me is unnecessary; his book will speak for
  itself. <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>[57]</span>His peculiar style will justify a little
  more quotation than is just necessary to prove the point. Looking at the
  "battle of opinion" now in progress, we see that Mr. Smith was a
  prescient:</p>

  <p>(P. 588.) "From the general review of parties in England, it is
  evident that no country in the world is better prepared for the great
  Battle of Opinion. Where else can the battle be fought but where the
  armies are arrayed? And here they all are, Greek, Roman, Anglican,
  Scotch, Lutheran, Calvinist, Established and Territorial, with Baronial
  Bishops, and Nonestablished of every grade&mdash;churches with living
  prophets and apostles, and churches with dead prophets and apostles, and
  apostolical churches without apostles, and philosophies without either
  prophets or apostles, and only wanting one more, 'the Christian Church,'
  like Aaron's rod, to swallow up and digest them all, and then bud and
  flourish. As if to prepare our minds for this desirable and inevitable
  consummation, different parties have been favored with a revival of that
  very spirit of revelation by which the Church itself was originally
  founded. There is a complete series of spiritual revelations in England
  and the United States, besides mesmeric phenomena that bear a resemblance
  to revelation, and thus gradually open the mind of the philosophical and
  infidel classes, as well as the professed believers of that old
  revelation which they never witnessed in living action, to a better
  understanding of that Law of Nature (for it is a Law of Nature) in which
  all revelation originates and by which its spiritual communications are
  regulated."</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith proceeds to say that there are <i>only</i> thirty-five
  incorporated churches in England, all formed from the New Testament
  except five, to each of which five he concedes a revelation of its own.
  The five are the Quakers, the Swedenborgians, the Southcottians, the
  Irvingites, and the Mormonites. Of Joanna Southcott he speaks as follows:
  <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>[58]</span></p>

  <p>(P. 592.) "Joanna Southcott<a name="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> is not very gallantly treated by the
  gentlemen of the Press, who, we believe, without knowing anything about
  her, merely pick up their idea of her character from the rabble. We once
  entertained the same rabble idea of her; but having read her
  works&mdash;for we really have read them&mdash;we now regard her with
  great respect. However, there is a great abundance of chaff and straw to
  her grain; but the grain is good, and as we do not eat either the chaff
  or straw if we can avoid it, nor even the raw grain, but thrash it and
  winnow it, and grind it and bake it, we find it, after undergoing this
  process, not only very palatable, but a special dainty of its kind. But
  the husk is an insurmountable obstacle to those learned and educated
  gentlemen who judge of books entirely by the style and the grammar, or
  those who eat grain as it grows, like the cattle. Such men would reject
  all prological revelation; for there never was and probably never will be
  a revelation by voice and vision communicated in classical manner. It
  would be an invasion of the rights and prerogatives of Humanity, and as
  contrary to the Divine and Established order of mundane government, as a
  field of quartern loaves or hot French rolls."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith's book is spiritualism from beginning to end; and my
  anonymous gainsayer, honest of course, is either ignorant of the work he
  thinks he has read, or has a most remarkable development of the organ of
  imperception.]</p>

  <p>Bryso was a mistaken man. Antipho had the disadvantage of being in
  advance of his age. He had the notion of which the modern geometry has
  made so much, that of <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>[60]</span>a circle being the polygon of an infinitely
  great number of sides. He could make no use of it, but the notion itself
  made him a sophist in the eyes of Aristotle, Eutocius,<a name="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> etc. Geber, an Arab astronomer, and a
  reputed conjurer in Europe, seems to have given his name to
  unintelligible language in the word <i>gibberish</i>. At one time
  <i>algebra</i> was traced to him; but very absurdly, though I have heard
  it suggested that <i>algebra</i> and <i>gibberish</i> must have had one
  inventor.</p>

  <p>Any person who meddles with the circle may find himself the crane who
  was netted among the geese: as Antipho for one, and Olivier de Serres<a
  name="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> for another. This last
  gentleman ascertained, by weighing, that the area of the circle is very
  nearly that of the square on the side of the inscribed equilateral
  triangle: which it is, as near as 3.162 ... to 3.141.... He did not
  pretend to more than approximation; but Montucla and others misunderstood
  him, and, still worse, misunderstood their own misunderstanding, and made
  him say the circle was exactly double of the equilateral triangle. He was
  let out of limbo by Lacroix, in a note to his edition of Montucla's
  <i>History of Quadrature</i>.</p>

  <p>I have looked for St. Vitus in catalogues of saints, but never found
  his legend, though he figures as a day-mark in the oldest almanacs. He
  must be properly accredited, since he was an archpriest. And I pronounce
  and ordain, by right accruing from the trouble I have taken in this
  subject, that he, St. Vitus, who leads his votaries a never-ending and
  unmeaning dance, shall henceforth be held and taken to be the patron
  saint of the circle-squarer. His day is the 15th of June, which is also
  that of St. Modestus,<a name="NtA_129"
  href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> with whom the said circle-squarer
  often has nothing to do. And he must not put himself under the first
  saint with a slantendicular reference to the other, as is much to be
  feared was done by the Cardinal who came to govern England with a title
  containing St. Pudentiana,<a name="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> who shares a day with <i>St.
  Dunstan</i>. The Archpriest of St. Vitus will have it that the square
  inscribed in a semicircle is half of the semicircle, or the circumference
  3-1/5 diameters. He is active and able, with <!-- Page 62 --><span

  except his paradoxes. In the second tract named he has given the
  testimonials of crowned heads and ministers, etc. as follows.
  Louis-Napoleon gives thanks. The minister at Turin refers it to the
  Academy of Sciences, and hopes so much labor will be judged <i>degna di
  pregio</i>.<a name="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> The
  Vice-Chancellor of Oxford&mdash;a blunt Englishman&mdash;begs to say that
  the University has never proposed the problem, as some affirm. The Prince
  Regent of Baden has received the work with lively interest. The Academy
  of Vienna is not in a position to enter into the question. The Academy of
  Turin offers the most <i>distinct</i> thanks. The Academy della Crusca
  attends only to literature, but gives thanks. The Queen of Spain has
  received the work with the highest appreciation. The University of
  Salamanca gives infinite thanks, and feels true satisfaction in having
  the book. Lord Palmerston gives thanks, by the hand of "William San." The
  Viceroy of Egypt, not being yet up in Italian, will spend his first
  moments of leisure in studying the book, when it shall have been
  translated into French: in the mean time he congratulates the author upon
  his victory over a problem so long held insoluble. All this is seriously
  published as a rate in aid of demonstration. If these royal compliments
  cannot make the circumference of a circle about 2 per cent. larger than
  geometry will have it &mdash;which is all that is wanted&mdash;no wonder

  There is an account in Mrs. Jameson's<a name="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> <i>History of Sacred and Legendary
  Art</i> (ed. of 1863, p. 544). But it seems that St. Vitus is the patron
  saint of <i>all</i> dances; so that I was not so far wrong in making him
  the protector of the cyclometers. Why he is represented with a cock is a
  disputed point, which is now made clear: next after <i>gallus

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CELEBRATED APPROXIMATIONS OF <span class="grk">&pi;</span>.</p>

  <p>The following is an extract from the <i>English Cyclopædia</i>, Art.
  <span class="sc">Tables</span>:</p>

  <p>"1853. William Shanks,<a name="NtA_136"
  href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> <i>Contributions to Mathematics,
  comprising chiefly the Rectification of the Circle to 607 Places of
  Tables</i>, London, 1853. (<span class="sc">Quadrature of the
  Circle.</span>) Here is a <i>table</i>, because it tabulates the results
  of the subordinate steps of this enormous calculation as far as 527
  decimals: the remainder being added as results only during the printing.
  For instance, one step is the calculation of the reciprocal of
  601.5<sup>601</sup>; and the result is given. The number of pages
  required to describe these results is 87. Mr. Shanks has also thrown off,
  as chips or splinters, the values of the base of Napier's logarithms, and
  of its logarithms of 2, 3, 5, 10, to 137 decimals; and the value of the
  modulus .4342 ... to 136 decimals: with the 13th, 25th, 37th ... up to
  the 721st powers of 2. These tremendous stretches of calculation&mdash;at
  least we so call them in our day&mdash;are useful in several respects;
  they prove more than <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>[64]</span>the capacity of this or that computer for
  labor and accuracy; they show that there is in the community an increase
  of skill and courage. We say in the community: we fully believe that the
  unequalled turnip which every now and then appears in the newspapers is a
  sufficient presumption that the average turnip is growing bigger, and the
  whole crop heavier. All who know the history of the quadrature are aware
  that the several increases of numbers of decimals to which <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> has been carried have been indications of a
  general increase in the power to calculate, and in courage to face the
  labor. Here is a comparison of two different times. In the day of
  Cocker,<a name="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> the pupil
  was directed to perform a common subtraction with a voice-accompaniment
  of this kind: '7 from 4 I cannot, but add 10, 7 from 14 remains 7, set
  down 7 and carry 1; 8 and 1 which I carry is 9, 9 from 2 I cannot, etc.'
  We have before us the announcement of the following <i>table</i>,
  undated, as open to inspection at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, in two
  diagrams of 7 ft. 2 in, by 6 ft. 6 in.: 'The figure 9 involved into the
  912th power, and antecedent powers or involutions, containing upwards of
  73,000 figures. Also, the proofs of the above, containing upwards of
  146,000 figures. By Samuel Fancourt, of Mincing Lane, London, and
  completed by him in the year 1837, at the age of sixteen. N.B. The whole
  operation performed by simple arithmetic.' The young operator calculated
  by successive squaring the 2d, 4th, 8th, etc., powers up to the 512th,
  with proof by division. But 511 multiplications by 9, in the short (or
  10-1) way, would have been much easier. The 2d, 32d, 64th, 128th, 256th,
  and 512th powers are given at the back of the announcement. The powers of
  2 have been calculated for many purposes. In Vol. II of his <i>Magia
  Universalis Naturæ et Artis</i>, Herbipoli, 1658, 4to, the Jesuit Gaspar
  Schott<a name="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> having
  discovered, on some grounds of theological <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[65]</span>magic, that the degrees
  of grace of the Virgin Mary were in number the 256th power of 2,
  calculated that number. Whether or no his number correctly represented
  the result he announced, he certainly calculated it rightly, as we find
  by comparison with Mr. Shanks."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>There is a point about Mr. Shanks's 608 figures of the value of <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> which attracts attention, perhaps without
  deserving it. It might be expected that, in so many figures, the nine
  digits and the cipher would occur each about the same number of times;
  that is, each about 61 times. But the fact stands thus: 3 occurs 68
  times; 9 and 2 occur 67 times each; 4 occurs 64 times; 1 and 6 occur 62
  times each; 0 occurs 60 times; 8 occurs 58 times; 5 occurs 56 times; and
  7 occurs only 44 times. Now, if all the digits were equally likely, and
  608 drawings were made, it is 45 to 1 against the number of sevens being
  as distant from the probable average (say 61) as 44 on one side or 78 on
  the other. There must be some reason why the number 7 is thus deprived of
  its fair share in the structure. Here is a field of speculation in which
  two branches of inquirers might unite. There is but one number which is
  treated with an unfairness which is incredible as an accident; and that
  number is the mystic number <i>seven</i>! If the cyclometers and the
  apocalyptics would lay their heads together until they come to a
  unanimous verdict on this phenomenon, and would publish nothing until
  they are of one mind, they would earn the gratitude of their
  race.&mdash;I was wrong: it is the Pyramid-speculator who should have
  been appealed to. A correspondent of my friend Prof. Piazzi Smyth<a
  name="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> notices that 3 is the
  number of most frequency, and that 3-1/7 is the nearest approximation to
  it in simple digits. Professor Smyth himself, whose word on Egypt is
  paradox of a very high order, backed by a great quantity of useful labor,
  the results which will be made available by those who do not receive <!--
  Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span>the
  paradoxes, is inclined to see confirmation for some of his theory in
  these phenomena.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CURIOUS CALCULATIONS.</p>

  <p>These paradoxes of calculation sometimes appear as illustrations of
  the value of a new method. In 1863, Mr. G. Suffield,<a name="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> M.A., and Mr. J.&nbsp;R. Lunn,<a
  name="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> M.A., of Clare College
  and of St. John's College, Cambridge, published the whole quotient of
  10000 ... divided by 7699, throughout the whole of one of the recurring
  periods, having 7698 digits. This was done in illustration of Mr.
  Suffield's method of <i>Synthetic division</i>.</p>

  <p>Another instance of computation carried to paradoxical length, in
  order to illustrate a method, is the solution of <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> -
  2<i>x</i> = 5, the example given of Newton's method, on which all
  improvements have been tested. In 1831, Fourier's<a name="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> posthumous work on equations showed
  33 figures of solution, got with enormous labor. Thinking this a good
  opportunity to illustrate the superiority of the method of W. G.
  Horner,<a name="NtA_143" href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> not yet
  known in France, and not much known in <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span>England, I proposed to
  one of my classes, in 1841, to beat Fourier on this point, as a Christmas
  exercise. I received several answers, agreeing with each other, to 50
  places of decimals. In 1848, I repeated the proposal, requesting that 50
  places might be exceeded: I obtained answers of 75, 65, 63, 58, 57, and
  52 places. But one answer, by Mr. W. Harris Johnston,<a name="NtA_144"
  href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> of Dundalk, and of the Excise Office,
  went to 101 decimal places. To test the accuracy of this, I requested Mr.
  Johnston to undertake another equation, connected with the former one in
  a way which I did not explain. His solution verified the former one, but
  he was unable to see the connection, even when his result was obtained.
  My reader may be as much at a loss: the two solutions are:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The results are published in the <i>Mathematician</i>, Vol. III, p.
  290. In 1851, another pupil of mine, Mr. J. Power Hicks,<a name="NtA_145"
  href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> carried the result to 152 decimal
  places, without knowing what Mr. Johnston had done. The result is in the

  <p>I remark that when I write the initial of a Christian name, the most
  usual name of that initial is understood. I never saw the name of W.&nbsp;G.
  Horner written at length, until I applied to a relative of his, who told
  me that he was, as I supposed, Wm. <i>George</i>, but that he was named
  after a relative of that <i>surname</i>.</p>

  <p>The two estates; or both worlds mathematically considered. London,
  1855, small (pp. 16).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The author has published mathematical works with his name. The present
  tract is intended to illustrate mathematically a point which may be
  guessed from the title. But the symbols do very little in the way of
  illustration: thus, <i>x</i> being the <i>present value</i> of the future
  estate (eternal happiness), and <i>a</i> of all that this world can give,
  the author impresses it on the mathematician that, <i>x</i> being
  infinitely greater than <i>a</i>, <i>x</i> + <i>a</i> = <i>x</i>, so that
  <i>a</i> need not be considered. This will not act much more powerfully
  on a mathematician by virtue of the symbols than if those same symbols
  had been dispensed with: even though, as the author adds, "It was this
  method of neglecting infinitely small quantities that Sir Isaac Newton
  was indebted to for his greatest discoveries."</p>

  <p>There has been a moderate quantity of well-meant attempt to enforce,
  sometimes motive, sometimes doctrine, by arguments drawn from
  mathematics, the proponents being persons unskilled in that science for
  the most part. The ground is very dangerous: for the illustration often
  turns the other way with greater power, in a manner which requires only a
  little more knowledge to see. I have, in my life, heard from the pulpit
  or read, at least a dozen times, that all sin is infinitely great, proved
  as follows. The greater the being, the greater the sin of any offence
  against him: therefore the offence committed against an infinite being is
  infinitely great. Now the mathematician, of which the proposers of this
  argument are not aware, is perfectly familiar with quantities which
  increase together, and never cease increasing, but so that one of them
  remains finite when <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>[71]</span>the other becomes infinite. In fact, the
  argument is a perfect <i>non sequitur</i>.<a name="NtA_152"
  href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> Those who propose it have in their
  minds, though in a cloudy and indefinite form, the idea of the increase
  of guilt being <i>proportionate</i> to the increase of greatness in the
  being offended. But this it would never do to state: for by such
  statement not only would the argument lose all that it has of the
  picturesque, but the asserted premise would have no strong air of exact
  truth. How could any one undertake to appeal to conscience to declare
  that an offence against a being 4-7/10 times as great as another is
  exactly, no more and no less, 4-7/10 times as great an offence against
  the other?</p>

  <p>The infinite character of the offence against an infinite being is
  laid down in Dryden's <i>Religio Laici</i>,<a name="NtA_153"
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> and is, no doubt, an old

  <p>Dryden, in the words "bears proportion" is in verse more accurate than
  most of the recent repeaters in prose. And this is not the only case of
  the kind in his argumentative poetry.</p>

  <p>My old friend, the late Dr. Olinthus Gregory,<a name="NtA_154"
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> who was a sound and learned
  mathematician, adopted this dangerous kind of illustration in his
  <i>Letters on the Christian Religion</i>. <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[72]</span>He argued, by parallel,
  from what he supposed to be the necessarily mysterious nature of the
  <i>impossible</i> quantity of algebra to the necessarily mysterious
  nature of certain doctrines of his system of Christianity. But all the
  difficulty and mystery of the impossible quantity is now cleared away by
  the advance of algebraical thought: and yet Dr. Gregory's book continues
  to be sold, and no doubt the illustration is still accepted as
  appropriate.</p>

  <p>The mode of argument used by the author of the tract above named has a
  striking defect. He talks of reducing this world and the next to "present
  value," as an actuary does with successive lives or next presentations.
  Does value make interest? and if not, why? And if it do, then the present
  value of an eternity is <i>not</i> infinitely great. Who is ignorant that
  a perpetual annuity at five per cent is worth only twenty years'
  purchase? This point ought to be discussed by a person who treats heaven
  as a deferred perpetual annuity. I do not ask him to do so, and would
  rather he did not; but if he <i>will</i> do it, he must either deal with
  the question of discount, or be asked the reason why.</p>

  <p>When a very young man, I was frequently exhorted to one or another
  view of religion by pastors and others who thought that a mathematical
  argument would be irresistible. And I heard the following more than once,
  and have since seen it in print, I forget where. Since eternal happiness
  belonged to the particular views in question, a benefit infinitely great,
  then, even if the probability of their arguments were small, or even
  infinitely small, yet the product of the chance and benefit, according to
  the usual rule, might give a result which no one ought in prudence to
  pass over. They did not see that this applied to all systems as well as
  their own. I take this argument to be the most perverse of all the
  perversions I have heard or read on the subject: there is some high
  authority for it, whom I forget.</p>

  <p>The moral of all this is, that such things as the preceding should be
  kept out of the way of those who are not <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>[73]</span>mathematicians, because
  they do not understand the argument; and of those who are, because they
  do.</p>

  <p>[The high authority referred to above is Pascal, an early cultivator
  of mathematical probability, and obviously too much enamoured of his new
  pursuit. But he conceives himself bound to wager on one side or the
  other. To the argument (<i><span class="correction" title="text reads `Pansées'"
  >Pensées</span></i>, ch. 7)<a name="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> that "le juste est de ne point
  parier," he answers, "Oui: mais il faut parier: vous êtes embarqué; et ne
  parier point que Dieu est, c'est parier qu'il n'est pas."<a
  name="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> Leaving Pascal's
  argument to make its way with a person who, <i>being a sceptic</i>, is
  yet positive that the issue is salvation or perdition, if a God there
  be,&mdash;for the case as put by Pascal requires this,&mdash;I shall
  merely observe that a person who elects to believe in God, as the best
  chance of gain, is not one who, according to Pascal's creed, or any other
  worth naming, will really secure that gain. I wonder whether Pascal's
  curious imagination ever presented to him in sleep his convert, in the
  future state, shaken out of a red-hot dice-box upon a red-hot
  hazard-table, as perhaps he might have been, if Dante had been the later
  of the two. The original idea is due to the elder Arnobius,<a
  name="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> who, as cited by
  Bayle,<a name="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> speaks
  thus:</p>

  <p>"Sed et ipse [Christus] quæ pollicetur, non probat. Ita est. Nulla
  enim, ut dixi, futurorum potest existere comprobatio. Cum ergo hæc sit
  conditio futurorum, ut teneri et comprehendi nullius possint

  ferat, quam omnino quod nullas? In illo enim periculi nihil est, si quod

  <p>Really Arnobius seems to have got as much out of the notion, in the
  third century, as if he had been fourteen centuries later, with the
  arithmetic of chances to help him.]</p>

  calculus to morals, socials, and politics. There is also a leading
  article on the subject, and some applications in notes to other articles.

  <p>I have a personal interest in this system, as will appear from the
  following extract from the newspaper:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We were subsequently referred to De Morgan's <i>Formal Logic</i> and
  Boole's <i>Laws of Thought</i><a name="NtA_161"
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> both very elaborate works, and
  greatly in the direction taken by ourselves. That the writers amazingly
  surpass us in learning we most willingly admit, but we venture to
  pronounce of both their learned treatises, that they deal with the
  subject in a mode that is scholastic to an excess.... That their works
  have been for a considerable space of time before the world and effected
  nothing, would argue that they have overlooked the vital nature of the
  theme.... On the whole, the writings of De Morgan and Boole go to the
  full justification of our principle without in any wise so trenching upon
  our ground as to render us open to reproach in claiming our Calculus as a
  great discovery.... But we renounce any paltry jealousy as to a matter so
  vast. If De Morgan and Boole have had a priority in the case, to them we
  cheerfully shall resign the glory and honor. If such be the truth, they
  have neither done justice to the discovery, nor to themselves [quite
  true]. They have, under the circumstances, acted like 'the foolish man,
  who roasteth not that which he taketh <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[76]</span>in hunting.... It will be
  sufficient for us, however, to be the Columbus of these great Americi,
  and popularize what they found, <i>if</i> they found it. We, as from the
  mountain top, will then become <i>their</i> trumpeters, and cry glory to
  De Morgan and glory to Boole, under Him who is the source of all glory,
  the only good and wise, to Whom be glory for ever! <i>If</i> they be our
  predecessors in this matter, they have, under Him, taken moral questions
  out of the category of probabilities, and rendered them perfectly
  certain. In that case, let their books be read by those who may doubt the

  will join us, and henceforth keep their light [<i>sic</i>] from under
  their bushel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>For myself, and for my old friend Mr. Boole, who I am sure would join
  me, I disclaim both priority, simultaneity, and posteriority, and request
  that nothing may be trumpeted from the mountain top except our abjuration
  of all community of thought or operation with this <i>Novum
  Organum</i>.</p>

  <p>To such community we can make no more claim than Americus could make
  to being the forerunner of Columbus who popularized his discoveries. We
  do not wish for any <span title="eurêkasi" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&eta;&kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;</span> and not
  even for <span title="heurêkasi" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F51;&rho;&eta;&kappa;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;</span>. For self
  and Boole, I point out what would have convinced either of us that this
  house is divided against itself.</p>

  <p><span class="grk">&Alpha;</span> being an apostolic element, <span
  class="grk">&delta;</span> the doctrinal element, and <span
  class="grk">&Chi;</span> the body of the faithful, the church is <span
  class="grk">&Alpha;</span>&nbsp;<span class="grk">&delta;</span>&nbsp;<span
  class="grk">&Chi;</span>, we are told. Also, that if <span
  class="grk">&Alpha;</span> become negative, or the Apostolicity become
  Diabolicity [my words]; or if <span class="grk">&delta;</span> become
  negative, and doctrine become heresy; or if <span
  class="grk">&Chi;</span> become negative, that is, if the faithful become
  unfaithful; the church becomes negative, "the very opposite to what it
  ought to be." For self and Boole, I admit this. But&mdash;which is not
  noticed&mdash;if <span class="grk">&Alpha;</span> and <span
  class="grk">&delta;</span> should <i>both</i> become negative, diabolical
  origin <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>[77]</span>and heretical doctrine, then the church,
  <span class="grk">&Alpha;</span>&nbsp;<span class="grk">&delta;</span>&nbsp;<span
  class="grk">&Chi;</span>, is still positive, what it ought to be, unless
  <span class="grk">&Chi;</span> be also negative, or the people unfaithful
  to it, in which case it is a bad church. Now, self and Boole&mdash;though
  I admit I have not asked my partner&mdash;are of opinion that a
  diabolical church with false doctrine does harm when the people are
  faithful, and can do good only when the people are unfaithful. We may be
  wrong, but this is what we <i>do</i> think. Accordingly, we have caught
  nothing, and can therefore roast nothing of our own: I content myself
  with roasting a joint of Mr. Gregg's larder.</p>

  <p>These mathematical vagaries have uses which will justify a large
  amount of quotation: and in a score of years this may perhaps be the only
  attainable record. I therefore proceed.</p>

  <p>After observing that by this calculus juries (heaven help them! say I)
  can calculate damages "almost to a nicety," and further that it is made
  abundantly evident that <i>c e x</i> is "the general expression for an
  individual," it is noted that the number of the Beast is not given in the
  Revelation in words at length, but as <span title="chxw'" class="grk"

  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> On this the following remark is
  made:</p>

  <p>"Can it be possible that we have in this case a specimen given to us
  of the arithmetic of heaven, and an expression revealed, which indicates
  by its function of addibility, the name of the church in question, and of
  each member of it; and by its function of multiplicability the doctrine,
  the mission, and the members of the great Synagogue of Apostacy? We
  merely propound these questions;&mdash;we do not pretend to solve
  them."</p>

  <p>After a translation in blank verse&mdash;a very pretty one&mdash;of
  the 18th Psalm, the author proceeds as follows, to render it into
  differential calculus:</p>

  <p>"And the whole tells us just this, that David did what he could. He
  augmented those elements of his constitution which were (<i>exceptis

  subject to himself, and the Almighty then augmented his personal
  qualities, and his vocational <i>status</i>. Otherwise, to throw the
  matter into the expression of our notation, the variable <i>e</i> was
  augmented, and <i>c&nbsp;x</i> rose proportionally. The law of the variation,
  according to our theory, would be thus expressed. The resultant was David
  the king <i>c&nbsp;e&nbsp;x</i> [<i>c</i> = <i>r</i>?] (who had been David the
  shepherd boy), and from the conditions of the theorem we have</p>

  product so great as to be equal in its amount to royalty, honor, wealth,
  and power, etc.: in short, to all the attributes of majesty."<a

  <p>The "solution of the family problem" is of high interest. It is to
  determine the effect on the family in general from a change [of conduct]
  in one of them. The person chosen is one of the maid-servants.</p>

  <p>"Let <i>c&nbsp;e&nbsp;x</i> be the father;
  <i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>e</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i><sub>1</sub> the mother,
  etc. The family then consists of the maid's master, her mistress, her
  young master, her young mistress, and fellow servant. Now the master's
  calling (or <i>c</i>) is to exercise his share of control over this
  servant, and mind the rest of his business: call this remainder <i>a</i>,
  and let his calling generally, or all his affairs, be to his maid-servant
  as <i>m</i> : <i>y</i>, i.e., <i>y</i> = (<i>mz</i>/<i>c</i>); ... <!--
  Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>[79]</span>and this
  expression will represent his relation to the servant. Consequently,</p>

  <p>is the expression for the father when viewed as the girl's
  master."</p>

  <p>I have no objection to repeat so far; but I will not give the formula
  for the maid's relation to her young master; for I am not quite sure that
  all young masters are to be trusted with it. Suffice it that the son will
  be affected directly as his influence over her, and inversely as his
  vocational power: if then he should have some influence and no vocational
  power, the effect on him would be infinite. This is dismal to think of.
  Further, the formula brings out that if one servant improve, the other
  must deteriorate, and <i>vice versa</i>. This is not the experience of
  most families: and the author remarks as follows:</p>

  <p>"That is, we should venture to say, a very beautiful result, and we
  may say it yielded us no little astonishment. What our calculation might
  lead to we never dreamt of; that it should educe a conclusion so
  recondite that our unassisted power never could have attained to, and
  which, if we could have conjectured it, would have been at best the most
  distant probability, that conclusion being itself, as it would appear,
  the quintessence of truth, afforded us a measure of satisfaction that was
  not slight."</p>

  <p>That the writings of Mr. Boole and myself "go to the full
  justification of" this "principle," is only true in the sense in which
  the Scotch use, or did use, the word <i>justification</i>.</p>

<p class="cenhead">A TRIBUTE TO BOOLE.</p>

  <p>[The last number of this Budget had stood in type for months, waiting
  until there should be a little cessation of correspondence more connected
  with the things of the day. <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>[80]</span>I had quite forgotten what it was to
  contain; and little thought, when I read the proof, that my allusions to
  my friend Mr. Boole, then in life and health, would not be printed till
  many weeks after his death. Had I remembered what my last number
  contained, I should have added my expression of regret and admiration to
  the numerous obituary testimonials, which this great loss to science has
  called forth.</p>

  <p>The system of logic alluded to in the last number of this series is
  but one of many proofs of genius and patience combined. I might
  legitimately have entered it among my <i>paradoxes</i>, or things counter
  to general opinion: but it is a paradox which, like that of Copernicus,
  excited admiration from its first appearance. That the symbolic processes
  of algebra, invented as tools of numerical calculation, should be
  competent to express every act of thought, and to furnish the grammar and
  dictionary of an all-containing system of logic, would not have been
  believed until it was proved. When Hobbes,<a name="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> in the time of the Commonwealth,
  published his <i>Computation or Logique</i>, he had a remote glimpse of
  some of the points which are placed in the light of day by Mr. Boole. The
  unity of the forms of thought in all the applications of reason, however
  remotely separated, will one day be matter of notoriety and common
  wonder: and Boole's name will be remembered in connection with one of the
  most important steps towards the attainment of this knowledge.]</p>

  <p>I write the titles of a couple out of several tracts which I have by
  me. But the number of publications issued by the promoters of this
  spirited attempt is very large indeed.<a name="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> The attempt itself has had no success
  with the mass of the public. This I do not regret. Had the world found
  that the change was useful, I should have gone contentedly with the
  stream; but not without regretting our old language. I admit the
  difficulties which our unpronounceable spelling puts in the way of
  learning to read: and I have no doubt that, as affirmed, it is easier to
  teach children phonetically, and afterwards to introduce them to our
  common system, than to proceed in the usual way. But by the usual way I
  mean proceeding by letters from the very beginning. If, which I am sure
  is a better plan, children be taught at the commencement very much by
  <i>complete words</i>, as if they were learning Chinese, and be gradually
  accustomed to <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>[82]</span>resolve the known words into letters, a
  fraction, perhaps a considerable one, of the advantage of the phonetic
  system is destroyed. It must be remembered that a phonetic system can
  only be an approximation. The differences of pronunciation existing among
  educated persons are so great, that, on the phonetic system, different
  persons ought to spell differently.</p>

  <p>But the phonetic party have produced something which will immortalize
  their plan: I mean their <i>shorthand</i>, which has had a fraction of
  the success it deserves. All who know anything of shorthand must see that
  nothing but a phonetic system can be worthy of the name: and the system
  promulgated is skilfully done. Were I a young man I should apply myself
  to it systematically. I believe this is the only system in which books
  were ever published. I wish some one would contribute to a public journal
  a brief account of the dates and circumstances of the phonetic movement,
  not forgetting a list of the books published in shorthand.</p>

  <p>A child beginning to read by himself may owe terrible dreams and
  waking images of horror to our spelling, as I did when six years old. In
  one of the common poetry-books there is an admonition against confining
  little birds in cages, and the child is asked what if a great giant,
  amazingly strong, were to take you away, shut you up,</p>

  idea that <i>vic-tu-als</i> were <i>vittles</i>: by the sound of the word

  <p>The worst of the phonetic shorthand book is that they nowhere, so far
  as I have seen, give <i>all</i> the symbols, in every stage of
  advancement, together, in one or following pages. It is symbols and talk,
  more symbols and more talk, etc. A universal view of the signs ought to

  eclipses, the image is more or less so directly before or behind the
  earth that, in the case of new moon, bright rays of the sun fall and bear
  upon the spot where the figure of the earth is brought to a focus, that
  is, bear upon the image of the earth, when a darkness beyond is produced

  <p>Mr. Symons, in this tract, insinuated that the rotation of the moon is
  one of the silver shrines of the craftsmen. To see a thing so clearly as
  to be satisfied that all who say they do not see it are telling wilful
  falsehood, is the nature of man. Many of all sects find much comfort in
  it, when they think of the others; many unbelievers solace themselves
  with it against believers; priests of old time founded the right of
  persecution upon it, and of our time, in some cases, the right of
  slander: many of the paradoxers make it an argument against students of
  science. But I must say for men of science, for the whole body, that they
  are fully persuaded of the honesty of the paradoxers. The simple truth
  is, that all those I have mentioned, believers, unbelievers, priests,
  paradoxers, are not so sure they are right in their points of difference
  that they can safely allow themselves to be persuaded of the honesty of

  honestly think so! This was suggested by what used to take place at
  Cambridge in my day. By statute, every B.A. was obliged to perform a
  certain number of disputations, and the <i>father</i> of the college had
  to affirm that it had been done. Some were performed in earnest: the rest
  were huddled over as follows. Two candidates occupied the places of the
  respondent and the opponent: <i>Recte statuit Newtonus</i>, said the
  respondent: <i>Recte non statuit Newtonus</i>,<a name="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> said the opponent. This was repeated
  the requisite number of times, and counted for as many <i>acts</i> and
  <i>opponencies</i>. The parties then changed places, and each unsaid what
  he had said on the other side of the house: I remember thinking that it
  was capital drill for the House of Commons, if any of us should ever get
  there. The process was repeated with every pair of candidates.</p>

  <p>The real disputations were very severe exercises. I was badgered for
  two hours with arguments given and answered in Latin,&mdash;or what we
  called Latin&mdash;against Newton's first section, Lagrange's<a
  name="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> derived functions, and
  Locke<a name="NtA_179" href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> on innate
  principles. And though I <i>took off</i> everything, and was pronounced
  by the moderator to have disputed <i>magno honore</i>,<a name="NtA_180"
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> I never had such a strain of thought
  in my life. For the inferior opponents were made as sharp as their
  betters by their tutors, who kept lists of queer objections, drawn from
  all quarters. The opponents used to meet the day before to compare their
  arguments, that the same might not come twice over. But, after I left
  Cambridge, it became the fashion to invite the respondent to be present,
  who therefore learnt all that was to be brought against him. This made
  the whole thing a farce: and the disputations were abolished.</p>

  because the "general body of intelligent men," who make no special study

  request the general body of intelligent men to find their own astronomy,
  and welcome. But the truth is, that this intelligent body knows better:
  and no persons know better that they know better than the speculators

  <p>Zetetic Astronomy: Earth not a globe. 1857 (Broadsheet).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though only a traveling lecturer's advertisement, there are so many
  arguments and quotations that it is a little pamphlet. The lecturer
  gained great praise from provincial newspapers for his ingenuity in
  proving that the earth is a flat, surrounded by ice. Some of the journals
  rather incline to the view: but the <i>Leicester Advertiser</i> thinks
  that the statements "would seem very seriously to invalidate some of the
  most important conclusions of modern astronomy," while the <i>Norfolk
  Herald</i> is clear that "there must be a great error on one side or the
  other." This broadsheet is printed at Aylesbury in 1857, and the lecturer
  calls himself <i>Parallax</i>: but at Trowbridge, in 1849, he was S.
  Goulden.<a name="NtA_183" href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> In this
  last advertisement is the following announcement: "A paper on the above
  subjects was read before the Council and Members of the Royal
  Astronomical Society, Somerset House, Strand, London (Sir John F.&nbsp;W.
  Herschel,<a name="NtA_184" href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>
  President), Friday, Dec. 8, 1848." No account of such a paper appears in
  the <i>Notice</i> for that month: I suspect that the above is Mr. S.
  Goulden's way of representing the following occurrence: Dec. 8, 1848, the
  Secretary of the Astronomical Society (De Morgan by name) said, at the
  close of the proceedings,&mdash;"Now, gentlemen, if you will promise not
  to tell the Council, I will read something for your amusement": and he
  then read a few of the arguments which had been transmitted by the
  lecturer. The fact is worth noting that from 1849 to 1857, arguments on
  the roundness or flatness of the earth did itinerate. I have <!-- Page 89
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>[89]</span>no doubt they
  did much good: for very few persons have any distinct idea of the
  evidence for the rotundity of the earth. The <i>Blackburn Standard</i>
  and <i>Preston Guardian</i> (Dec. 12 and 16, 1849) unite in stating that
  the lecturer ran away from his second lecture at Burnley, having been
  rather too hard pressed at the end of his first lecture to explain why
  the large hull of a ship disappeared before the sails. The persons
  present and waiting for the second lecture assuaged their disappointment
  by concluding that the lecturer had slipped off the icy edge of his flat
  disk, and that he would not be seen again till he peeped up on the
  opposite side.</p>

  <p>But, strange as it may appear, the opposer of the earth's roundness
  has more of a case&mdash;or less of a want of case&mdash;than the
  arithmetical squarer of the circle. The evidence that the earth is round
  is but cumulative and circumstantial: scores of phenomena ask, separately
  and independently, what other explanation can be imagined except the
  sphericity of the earth. The evidence for the earth's figure is
  tremendously powerful of its kind; but the proof that the circumference
  is 3.14159265... times the diameter is of a higher kind, being absolute
  mathematical demonstration.</p>

  <p>The Zetetic system still lives in lectures and books; as it ought to
  do, for there is no way of teaching a truth comparable to opposition. The
  last I heard of it was in lectures at Plymouth, in October, 1864. Since
  this time a prospectus has been issued of a work entitled "The Earth not
  a Globe"; but whether it has been published I do not know. The contents
  are as follows:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"The Earth a Plane&mdash;How circumnavigated.&mdash;How time is lost
  or gained.&mdash;Why a ship's hull disappears (when outward bound) before

  etc.&mdash;Why a pendulum vibrates with less velocity at the Equator than
  <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[90]</span>at

  <p>I wish there were geoplatylogical lectures in every town; in England
  (<i>platylogical</i>, in composition, need not mean <i>babbling</i>). The
  late Mr. Henry Archer<a name="NtA_185"
  href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> would, if alive, be very much obliged
  to me for recording his vehement denial of the roundness of the earth: he
  was excited if he heard any one call it a globe. I cannot produce his
  proof from the Pyramids, and from some caves in Arabia. He had other
  curious notions, of course: I should no more believe that a flat earth
  was a man's only paradox, than I should that Dutens,<a name="NtA_186"
  href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> the editor of Leibnitz, was eccentric
  only in supplying a tooth which he had lost by one which he found in an
  Italian tomb, and fully believed that it had once belonged to Scipio
  Africanus, whose family vault was discovered, it is supposed, in 1780.
  Mr. Archer is of note as <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>[91]</span>the suggester of the perforated border of
  the postage-stamps, and, I think, of the way of doing it; for this he got
  4000<i>l.</i> reward. He was a civil engineer.</p>

  <p>(<i>August 28, 1865.</i>) The <i>Zetetic Astronomy</i> has come into
  my hands. When, in 1851, I went to see the Great Exhibition, I heard an
  organ played by a performer who seemed very desirous to exhibit one
  particular stop. "What do you think of that stop?" I was
  asked.&mdash;"That depends on the name of it," said I.&mdash;"Oh! what
  can the name have to do with the sound? 'that which we call a rose,'
  etc."&mdash;"The name has everything to do with it: if it be a
  flute-stop, I think it very harsh; but if it be a railway-whistle-stop, I
  think it very sweet." So as to this book: if it be childish, it is
  clever; if it be mannish, it is unusually foolish. The flat earth,
  floating tremulously on the sea; the sun moving always over the flat,
  giving day when near enough, and night when too far off; the
  self-luminous moon, with a semi-transparent invisible moon, created to
  give her an eclipse now and then; the new law of perspective, by which
  the vanishing of the hull before the masts, usually thought to prove the
  earth globular, really proves it flat;&mdash;all these and other things
  are well fitted to form exercises for a person who is learning the
  elements of astronomy. The manner in which the sun dips into the sea,
  especially in tropical climates, upsets the whole. Mungo Park,<a
  name="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> I think, gives an
  African hypothesis which explains phenomena better than this. The sun
  dips into the western ocean, and the people there cut him in pieces, fry
  him in a pan, and then join him together again, take him round the
  underway, and set him up in the east. I hope this book will be read, and
  that many will be puzzled by it: for there are many whose notions of
  astronomy deserve no better fate. There is no subject on which there is
  so little <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>[92]</span>accurate conception as that of the motions
  of the heavenly bodies. The author, though confident in the extreme,
  neither impeaches the honesty of those whose opinions he assails, nor
  allots them any future inconvenience: in these points he is worthy to
  live on a globe, and to revolve in twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>(<i>October, 1866.</i>) A follower appears, in a work dedicated to the
  preceding author: it is <i>Theoretical Astronomy examined and exposed by
  Common Sense</i>. The author has 128 well-stuffed octavo pages. I hope he
  will not be the last. He prints the newspaper accounts of his work: the
  <i>Church Times</i> says&mdash;not seeing how the satire might be
  retorted&mdash;"We never began to despair of Scripture until we
  discovered that 'Common Sense' had taken up the cudgels in its defence."
  This paper considers our author as the type of a <i>Protestant</i>. The
  author himself, who gives a summary of his arguments in verse, has one
  couplet which is worth quoting:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  argued with, and to be treated as reputable <!-- Page 93 --><span

  "Common Sense" reminds us that no amount of "blatant ridicule" will turn
  right into wrong. He is perfectly correct: but then no amount of bad
  argument will turn wrong into right. These two things balance; and we are
  just where we were: but you should answer our arguments, for whom, I ask?
  Would reason convince this kind of reasoner? The issue is a short and a
  clear one. If these parties be what I contend they are, then ridicule is
  made for them: if not, for what or for whom? If they be right, they are
  only passing through the appointed trial of all good things. Appeal is
  made to the future: and my Budget is intended to show samples of the long
  line of heroes who have fallen without victory, each of whom had his day
  of confidence and his prophecy of success. Let the future decide: they
  say roundly that the earth is flat; I say flatly that it is round.</p>

  <p>The paradoxers all want reason, and not ridicule: they are all
  accessible, and would yield to conviction. Well then, let them reason
  with one another! They divide into squads, each with a subject, and as
  many different opinions as persons in each squad. If they be really what
  they say they are, the true man of each set can put down all the rest,
  and can come crowned with glory and girdled with scalps, to the attack on
  the orthodox misbelievers. But they know, to a man, that the rest are not
  fit to be reasoned with: they pay the regulars the compliment of
  believing that the only chance lies with them. They think in their
  hearts, each one for himself, that ridicule is of fit appliance to the
  rest.</p>

  satisfactory to see that we retain the standards which were given by
  unwritten revelation 700 years before Moses. This is lighting the candle

  me that Sir Philip Francis, in a short conversation with him, made only
  this remark, "You may depend upon it you are quite mistaken:" the phrase
  appears to me remarkable; it has an air of criticism on the book, free
  from all personal denial. He also mentioned that a hearer told him that
  Sir Philip said, speaking of writers on the question,&mdash;"Those
  fellows, for half-a-crown, would prove that Jesus Christ was Junius."</p>

  <p>Mr. Taylor implies, I think, that he is the first who started the
  suggestion that Sir Philip Francis was Junius, which I have no means
  either of confirming or refuting. If it be so [and I now know that Mr.
  Taylor himself never heard of any predecessor], the circumstance is very
  remarkable: it is seldom indeed that the first proposer of any solution
  of a great and vexed question is the person who so nearly establishes his
  point in general opinion as Mr. Taylor has done.</p>

  <p>As to the Junius question in general, there is a little bit of the
  philosophy of horse-racing which may be usefully applied. A man who is so
  confident of his horse that he places him far above any other, may
  nevertheless, and does, refuse to give odds against all in the field: for
  many small adverse chances united make a big chance for one or other of
  the opponents. I suspect Mr. Taylor has made it at least 20 to 1 for
  Francis against any one competitor who has been named: but what the odds
  may be against the <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>[97]</span>whole field is more difficult to settle.
  What if the real Junius should be some person not yet named?</p>

  <p>Mr. Jopling, <i>Leisure Hour</i>, May 23, 1863, relies on the porphyry
  coffer of the Great Pyramid, in which he finds "the most ancient and
  accurate standard of measure in existence."</p>

  <p>I am shocked at being obliged to place a thoughtful and learned
  writer, and an old friend, before such a successor as he here meets with.
  But chronological arrangement defies all other arrangement.</p>

  <p>(I had hoped that the preceding account would have met Mr. Taylor's
  eye in print: but he died during the last summer. For a man of a very
  thoughtful and quiet temperament, he had a curious turn for vexed
  questions. But he reflected very long and very patiently before he
  published: and all his works are valuable for their accurate learning,
  whichever side the reader may take.)</p>

  well-ransacked works of reference, those who look into them will be glad
  to see this <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  extracts, faithfully copied as to type. The Italic is from the New
  Testament; the Roman is the requisite interpretation:</p>

  <p>"Robert Cottle '<i>was numbered</i> (5196) <i>with the
  transgressors</i>' at the back of the Church in Norwood Cemetery, May 12,
  1858&mdash;Isa. liii. 12. The Rev. J.&nbsp;G. Collinson, Minister of St.
  James's Church, Chapham, the then district church, before All Saints was
  built, read the funeral service <i>over the Sepulchre wherein never
  before man was laid</i>.</p>

  <p>"<i>Hewn on the stone</i>, 'at the mouth of the Sepulchre,' is his
  name,&mdash;Robert Cottle, born at Bristol, June 2, 1774; died at
  Kirkstall Lodge, Clapham Park, May 6, 1858. <i>And that day</i> (May 12,
  1858) <i>was the preparation</i> (day and year for 'the <span

  the widowed mother of the Father's house, at Kirkstall Lodge&mdash;John
  xiv. 2, 3). <i>And the Sabbath</i> (Christmas Day, Dec. 25, 1859) <i>drew
  on</i> (for the resurrection of the Christian body on 'the third
  [Protestant Sun]-day'&mdash;1 Cor. xv. 35). <i>Why seek ye the living</i>
  (God of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Heb. xii. 22; Rev. iii. 12) <i>among the

  grave), <i>but is risen</i> (in the person of the Holy Ghost, from the
  supper of 'the dead in the second death' of Paganism). <i>Remember how he
  spake unto you</i> (in the church of the Rev. George Clayton,<a

  <p>"... Queen Elizabeth, from A.D. 1558 to 1566. <i>And this</i> <span
  class="scac">WORD</span> <i>yet once more</i> (by a second
  Elizabeth&mdash;the <span class="scac">WORD</span> of his oath)
  <i>signifieth</i> (at John Scott's baptism of the Holy Ghost) <i>the

  He is our defence, no nation can invade us.</p>

  Chapel, to which little flock she gave the revelation (Acts. i. 13, 15)
  <i>of Jesus the same</i> King of the Jews <i>yesterday</i> at the prayer
  meeting, Dec. 31, 1841, <i>and to-day</i>, <!-- Page 100 --><span

  death' <i>between the two</i> Imperial <i>soldiers</i> of France and

  <i>hands</i>.</p>

  <p>"<i>I say unto thee</i>, Robert Ashton, <i>thou art Peter</i>, a
  stone, <i>and upon this rock</i>, of truth, <i>will I</i> Elizabeth, the
  angel of Jesus, <i>build my</i> Cottle <i>Church, and the gates of
  hell</i>, the doors of St. Peter, at Rome, shall not prevail against
  it&mdash;Matt. xvi. 18. Rev. iii. 7-12."</p>

  <p>This will be enough for the purpose. When any one who pleases can
  circulate new revelations of this kind, uninterrupted and unattended to,
  new revelations will cease to be a good investment of excentricity. I
  take it for granted that the gentlemen whose names are mentioned have
  nothing to do with the circulars or their doctrines. Any lady who may
  happen to be intrusted with a revelation may nominate her own pastor, or
  any other clergyman, one of her apostles; and it is difficult to say to
  what court the nominees can appeal to get the commission abrogated.</p>

  <p><i>March 16, 1865.</i> During the last two years the circulars have
  continued. It is hinted that funds are low: and two gentlemen who are
  represented as gone "to Bethlehem asylum in despair" say that Mrs. Cottle
  "will spend all that she hath, while Her Majesty's Ministers are
  flourishing on the wages of sin." The following is perhaps one of the
  most remarkable passages in the whole:</p>

  <p>"<i>Extol and magnify Him</i> (Jehovah, the Everlasting God, see the
  Magnificat and Luke i. 45, 46&mdash;68&mdash;73&mdash;79), <i>that
  rideth</i> (by rail and steam over land and sea, from his holy habitation
  at Kirkstall Lodge, Psa. lxxvii. 19, 20), <i>upon the</i> (Cottle)
  <i>heavens, as it were</i> (Sept. 9, 1864, see pages 21, 170), <i>upon
  an</i> (exercising, Psa. cxxxi. 1), <i>horse</i>-(chair, bought of Mr.
  John Ward, Leicester-square)." <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>[101]</span></p>

  <p>I have pretty good evidence that there is a clergyman who thinks Mrs.
  Cottle a very sensible woman.</p>

  <p>[<i>The Cottle Church.</i> Had I chanced to light upon it at the time
  of writing, I should certainly have given the following. A printed letter
  to the <i>Western Times</i>, by Mr. Robert Cottle, was accompanied by a
  manuscript letter from Mrs. Cottle, apparently a circular. The date was
  Nov<sup>r</sup>. 1853, and the subject was the procedure against Mr.
  Maurice<a name="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> at King's
  College for doubting that God would punish human sins by an existence of
  torture lasting through years numbered by millions of millions of
  millions of millions (repeat the word <i>millions</i> without end,) etc.
  The memory of Mr. Cottle has, I think, a right to the quotation: he seems
  to have been no participator in the notions of his wife:</p>

  <p>"The clergy of the Established Church, taken at the round number of
  20,000, may, in their first estate, be likened to 20,000 gold blanks,
  destined to become sovereigns, in succession,&mdash;they are placed
  between the matrix of the Mint, when, by the pressure of the screw, they
  receive the impress that fits them to become part of the current coin of
  the realm. In a way somewhat analogous this great body of the clergy have
  each passed through the crucibles of Oxford and Cambridge,&mdash;have
  been assayed by the Bishop's chaplain, touching the health of their
  souls, and the validity of their call by the Divine Spirit, and then the
  gentle pressure of a prelate's hand upon their heads; and the
  words&mdash;'Receive the Holy Ghost,' have, in a brief space of time,
  wrought a <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>[102]</span>change in them, much akin to the miracle
  of transubstantiation&mdash;the priests are completed, and they become
  the current ecclesiastical coin of our country. The whole body of clergy,
  here spoken of, have undergone the preliminary induction of baptism and
  confirmation; and all have been duly ordained, <i>professing</i> to hold
  one faith, and to believe in the selfsame doctrines! In short, to be as
  identical as the 20,000 sovereigns, if compared one with the other. But
  mind is not malleable and ductile, like gold; and all the preparations of
  tests, creeds, and catechisms will not insure uniformity of belief. No
  stamp of orthodoxy will produce the same impress on the minds of
  different men. Variety is manifest, and patent, upon everything mental
  and material. The Almighty has not created, nor man fashioned, two things
  alike! How futile, then, is the attempt to shape and mould man's
  apprehension of divine truth by one fallible standard of man's invention!
  If proof of this be required, an appeal might be made to history and the
  experience of eighteen hundred years."</p>

  <p>This is an argument of force against the reasonableness of expecting
  tens of thousands of educated readers of the New Testament to find the
  doctrine above described in it. The lady's argument against the doctrine
  itself is very striking. Speaking of an outcry on this matter among the
  Dissenters against one of their body, who was the son of "the White Stone
  (Rev. ii. 17), or the Roman cement-maker," she says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If the doctrine for which they so wickedly fight were true, what
  would become of the black gentlemen for whose redemption I have been
  sacrificed from April 8 1839."</p>

  <p>There are certainly very curious points about this revelation. There
  have been many surmises about the final restoration of the infernal
  spirits, from the earliest ages of Christianity until our own day: a
  collection of them would be worth making. On reading this in proof, I see
  a possibility that by "black gentlemen" may be meant the clergy: <!--

</blockquote>

  <p>When my work appeared in numbers, I had not anything like an adequate
  idea of Mr. James Smith's superiority to the rest of the world in the
  points in which he is superior. He is beyond a doubt the ablest head at
  unreasoning, and the greatest hand at writing it, of all who have tried
  in our day to attach their names to an error. Common cyclometers sink
  into puny orthodoxy by his side.</p>

  <p>The behavior of this singular character induces me to pay him the
  compliment which Achilles paid Hector, to drag him round the walls again
  and again. He was treated with unusual notice and in the most gentle
  manner. The unnamed mathematician, E.&nbsp;M. bestowed a volume of mild
  correspondence upon him; Rowan Hamilton<a name="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> quietly proved him wrong in a way
  accessible to an ordinary schoolboy; Whewell,<a name="NtA_202"
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> as we shall see, gave him the means
  of seeing himself wrong, even more easily than by Hamilton's method.
  Nothing would do; it was small kick and silly fling at all; and he
  exposed his conceit by alleging that he, James Smith, had placed Whewell
  in the stocks. He will therefore be universally pronounced a proper
  object of the severest literary punishment: but the opinion of all who
  can put two propositions together will be that of the many strokes I have
  given, the hardest and most telling are my republications of his own
  attempts to reason.</p>

  <p>He will come out of my hands in the position he ought <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[105]</span>to hold, the
  Supreme Pontiff of cyclometers, the vicegerent of St. Vitus upon earth,
  the Mamamouchi of burlesque on inference. I begin with a review of him
  which appeared in the <i>Athenæum</i> of May 11, 1861. Mr. Smith says I
  wrote it: this I neither affirm nor deny; to do either would be a sin
  against the editorial system elsewhere described. Many persons tell me
  they know me by my style; let them form a guess: I can only say that many
  have declared as above while fastening on me something which I had never
  seen nor heard of.</p>

  <p>"A few weeks ago we were in perpetual motion. We did not then suppose
  that anything would tempt us on a circle-squaring expedition: but the
  circumstances of the book above named have a peculiarity which induces us
  to give it a few words.</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Smith, a gentleman residing near Liverpool, was some years
  ago seized with the <i>morbus cyclometricus</i>.<a name="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> The symptoms soon took a defined
  form: his circumference shrank into exactly 3-1/8 times his diameter,
  instead of close to 3-16/113, which the mathematician knows to be so near
  to truth that the error is hardly at the rate of a foot in 2,000 miles.
  This shrinking of the circumference remained until it became absolutely
  necessary that it should be examined by the British Association. This
  body, which as Mr. James Smith found to his sorrow, has some interest in
  'jealously guarding the mysteries of their profession,' refused at first
  to entertain the question. On this Mr. Smith changed his 'tactics' and
  the name of his paper, and smuggled in the subject under the form of 'The
  Relations of a Circle inscribed in a Square'! The paper was thus forced
  upon the Association, for Mr. Smith informs us that he <!-- Page 106
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[106]</span>'gave the
  Section to understand that he was not the man that would permit even the
  British Association to trifle with him.' In other words, the Association
  bore with and were bored with the paper, as the shortest way out of the
  matter. Mr. Smith also circulated a pamphlet. Some kind-hearted man, who
  did not know the disorder as well as we do, and who appears in Mr.
  Smith's handsome octavo as E.&nbsp;M.&mdash;the initials of 'eminent
  mathematician'&mdash;wrote to him and offered to show him in a page that
  he was all wrong. Mr. Smith thereupon opened a correspondence, which is
  the bulk of the volume. When the correspondence was far advanced, Mr.
  Smith announced his intention to publish. His benevolent
  instructor&mdash;we mean in intention&mdash;protested against the
  publication, saying 'I do not wish to be gibbeted to the world as having
  been foolish enough to enter upon what I feel now to have been a
  ridiculous enterprise.'</p>

  <p>"For this Mr. Smith cared nothing: he persisted in the publication,
  and the book is before us. Mr. Smith has had so much grace as to conceal
  his kind adviser's name under E.&nbsp;M., that is to say, he has divided the
  wrong among all who may be suspected of having attempted so hopeless a
  task as that of putting a little sense into his head. He has violated the
  decencies of private life. Against the will of the kind-hearted man who
  undertook his case, he has published letters which were intended for no
  other purpose than to clear his poor head of a hopeless delusion. He
  deserves the severest castigation; and he will get it: his abuse of
  confidence will stick by him all his days. Not that he has done his
  benefactor&mdash;in intention, again&mdash;any harm. The patience with
  which E.&nbsp;M. put the blunders into intelligible form, and the perseverance
  with which he tried to find a cranny-hole for common reasoning to get in
  at, are more than respectable: they are admirable. It is, we can assure
  E.&nbsp;M., a good thing that the nature of the circle-squarer should be so
  completely exposed as in this volume. The benefit which he intended Mr.
  James Smith may be <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>[107]</span>conferred upon others. And we should very
  much like to know his name, and if agreeable to him, to publish it. As to
  Mr. James Smith, we can only say this: he is not mad. Madmen reason
  rightly upon wrong premises: Mr. Smith reasons wrongly upon no premises
  at all.</p>

  <p>"E.&nbsp;M. very soon found out that, to all appearance, Mr. Smith got a
  circle of 3-1/8 times the diameter by making it the supposition to set
  out with that there was such a circle; and then finding certain
  consequences which, so it happened, were not inconsistent with the
  supposition on which they were made. Error is sometimes self-consistent.
  However, E.&nbsp;M., to be quite sure of his ground, wrote a short letter,
  stating what he took to be Mr. Smith's hypothesis, containing the
  following: 'On AC as diameter, describe the circle D, which by hypothesis
  shall be equal to three and one-eighth times the length of AC.... I beg,
  before proceeding further, to ask whether I have rightly stated your
  argument.' To which Mr. Smith replied: 'You have stated my argument with
  perfect accuracy.' Still E.&nbsp;M. went on, and we could not help, after the
  above, taking these letters as the initials of Everlasting Mercy. At
  last, however, when Mr. Smith flatly denied that the area of the circle
  lies between those of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons, E.&nbsp;M. was
  fairly beaten, and gave up the task. Mr. Smith was left to write his
  preface, to talk about the certain victory of truth&mdash;which, oddly
  enough, is the consolation of all hopelessly mistaken men; to compare
  himself with Galileo; and to expose to the world the perverse behavior of
  the Astronomer Royal, on whom he wanted to fasten a conversation, and who
  replied, 'It would be a waste of time, Sir, to listen to anything you
  could have to say on such a subject.'</p>

  <p>"Having thus disposed of Mr. James Smith, we proceed to a few remarks
  on the subject: it is one which a journal would never originate, but
  which is rendered necessary from time to time by the attempts of the
  autopseustic to become <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[108]</span>heteropseustic. To the mathematician we
  have nothing to say: the question is, what kind of assurance can be given
  to the world at large that the wicked mathematicians are not acting in
  concert to keep down their superior, Mr. James Smith, the current Galileo
  of the quadrature of the circle.</p>

  <p>"Let us first observe that this question does not stand alone:
  independently of the millions of similar problems which exist in higher
  mathematics, the finding of the diagonal of a square has just the same
  difficulty, namely, the entrance of a pair of lines of which one cannot
  be definitely expressed by means of the other. We will show the reader
  who is up to the multiplication-table how he may go on, on, on, ever
  nearer, never there, in finding the diagonal of a square from the
  side.</p>

  <p>After the second, each number is made up of double the last increased
  by the last but one: thus, 5 is 1 more than twice 2, 12 is 2 more than
  twice 5, 239 is 41 more than twice 99. Now, take out two adjacent numbers
  from the upper line, and the one below the first from the lower: as</p>

  <p>Multiply together 99 and 169, giving 16,731. If, then, you will say
  that 70 diagonals are exactly equal to 99 sides, you are in error about
  the diagonal, but an error the amount of which is not so great as the
  16,731st part of the diagonal. Similarly, to say that five diagonals make
  exactly seven sides does not involve an error of the 84th part of the
  diagonal.</p>

  <p>"Now, why has not the question of <i>crossing the square</i> been as
  celebrated as that of <i>squaring the circle</i>? Merely because Euclid
  demonstrated the impossibility of the first <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span>question, while that of
  the second was not demonstrated, completely, until the last century.</p>

  <p>"The mathematicians have many methods, totally different from each
  other, of arriving at one and the same result, their celebrated
  approximation to the circumference of the circle. An intrepid calculator
  has, in our own time, carried his approximation to what they call 607
  decimal places: this has been done by Mr. Shanks,<a name="NtA_204"
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> of Houghton-le-Spring, and Dr.
  Rutherford<a name="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> has
  verified 441 of these places. But though 607 looks large, the general
  public will form but a hazy notion of the extent of accuracy acquired. We
  have seen, in Charles Knight's<a name="NtA_206"
  href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> <i>English Cyclopædia</i>, an account
  of the matter which may illustrate the unimaginable, though rationally
  conceivable, extent of accuracy obtained.</p>

  <p>"Say that the blood-globule of one of our animalcules is a millionth
  of an inch in diameter. Fashion in thought a globe like our own, but so
  much larger that our globe is but a blood-globule in one of its
  animalcules: never mind the microscope which shows the creature being
  rather a bulky instrument. Call this the first globe <i>above</i> us. Let
  the first globe above us be but a blood-globule, as to size, in the
  animalcule of a still larger globe, which call the second globe above us.
  Go on in this way to the twentieth globe above us. Now go down just as
  far on the other side. Let the blood-globule with which we started be a
  globe peopled with animals like ours, but rather smaller: <!-- Page 110
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>[110]</span>and call this
  the first globe below us. Take a blood-globule out of this globe, people
  it, and call it the second globe below us: and so on to the twentieth
  globe below us. This is a fine stretch of progression both ways. Now give
  the giant of the twentieth globe <i>above</i> us the 607 decimal places,
  and, when he has measured the diameter of his globe with accuracy worthy
  of his size, let him calculate the circumference of his equator from the
  607 places. Bring the little philosopher from the twentieth globe
  <i>below</i> us with his very best microscope, and set him to see the
  small error which the giant must make. He will not succeed, unless his
  microscopes be much better for his size than ours are for ours.</p>

  <p>"Now it must be remembered by any one who would laugh at the closeness
  of the approximation, that the mathematician generally goes
  <i>nearer</i>; in fact his theorems have usually no error at all. The
  very person who is bewildered by the preceding description may easily
  forget that if there were <i>no error at all</i>, the Lilliputian of the
  millionth globe below us could not find a flaw in the Brobdingnagian of
  the millionth globe above. The three angles of a triangle, of perfect
  accuracy of form, are <i>absolutely</i> equal to two right angles; no
  stretch of progression will detect <i>any</i> error.</p>

  <p>"Now think of Mr. Lacomme's mathematical adviser (<i>ante</i>, Vol. I,
  p. 46) making a difficulty of advising a stonemason about the quantity of
  pavement in a circular floor!</p>

  <p>"We will now, for our non-calculating reader, put the matter in
  another way. We see that a circle-squarer can advance, with the utmost
  confidence, the assertion that when the diameter is 1,000, the
  circumference is accurately 3,125: the mathematician declaring that it is
  a trifle more than 3,141½. If the squarer be right, the mathematician has
  erred by about a 200th part of the whole: or has not kept his accounts
  right by about 10<i>s.</i> in every 100<i>l.</i> Of course, if he set out
  with such an error he will accumulate blunder upon blunder. Now, if there
  be a process in which <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>[111]</span>close knowledge of the circle is
  requisite, it is in the prediction of the moon's place&mdash;say, as to
  the time of passing the meridian at Greenwich&mdash;on a given day. We
  cannot give the least idea of the complication of details: but common
  sense will tell us that if a mathematician cannot find his way round the
  circle without a relative error four times as big as a stockbroker's
  commission, he must needs be dreadfully out in his attempt to predict the
  time of passage of the moon. Now, what is the fact? His error is less
  than a second of time, and the moon takes 27 days odd to revolve. That is
  to say, setting out with 10<i>s.</i> in 100<i>l.</i> of error in his
  circumference, he gets within the fifth part of a farthing in
  100<i>l.</i> in predicting the moon's transit. Now we cannot think that
  the respect in which mathematical science is held is great
  enough&mdash;though we find it not small&mdash;to make this go down. That
  respect is founded upon a notion that right ends are got by right means:
  it will hardly be credited that the truth can be got to farthings out of
  data which are wrong by shillings. Even the celebrated Hamilton<a
  name="NtA_207" href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> of Edinburgh, who held
  that in mathematics there was no way of going wrong, was fully impressed
  with the belief that this was because error was avoided from the
  beginning. He never went so far as to say that a mathematician who begins
  wrong must end right somehow.</p>

  <p>"There is always a difficulty about the mode in which the thinking man
  of common life is to deal with subjects he has not studied to a
  professional extent. He must form opinions on matters theological,
  political, legal, medical, and social. If he can make up his mind to
  choose a guide, there is, of course, no perplexity: but on all the
  subjects mentioned the direction-posts point different ways. Now why
  should he not form his opinion upon an abstract mathematical question?
  Why not conclude that, as to the circle, it is possible Mr. James Smith
  may be the man, just <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>as Adam Smith<a name="NtA_208"
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> was the man of things then to come,
  or Luther, or Galileo? It is true that there is an unanimity among
  mathematicians which prevails in no other class: but this makes the
  chance of their all being wrong only different in degree. And more than
  this, is it not generally thought among us that priests and physicians
  were never so much wrong as when there was most appearance of unanimity
  among them? To the preceding questions we see no answer except this, that
  the individual inquirer may as rationally decide a mathematical question
  for himself as a theological or a medical question, so soon as he can put
  himself into a position in mathematics, level with that in which he
  stands in theology or medicine. The every-day thought and reading of
  common life have a certain resemblance to the thought and reading
  demanded by the learned faculties. The research, the balance of evidence,
  the estimation of probabilities, which are used in a question of
  medicine, are closely akin in character, however different the matter of
  application, to those which serve a merchant to draw his conclusions
  about the markets. But the mathematicians have methods of their own, to
  which nothing in common life bears close analogy, as to the nature of the
  results or the character of the conclusions. The logic of mathematics is
  certainly that of common life: but the data are of a different species;
  they do not admit of doubt. An expert arithmetician, such as is Mr. J.
  Smith, may fancy that calculation, merely as such, is mathematics: but
  the value of his book, and in this point of view it is not small, is the
  full manner in which it shows that a practised arithmetician, venturing
  into the field of mathematical demonstration, may show himself utterly
  destitute of all that distinguishes the reasoning geometrical
  investigator from the calculator.</p>

<p><!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[113]</span></p>

  <p>"And further, it should be remembered that in mathematics the power of
  verifying results far exceeds that which is found in anything else: and
  also the variety of distinct methods by which they can be attained. It
  follows from all this that a person who desires to be as near the truth
  as he can will not judge the results of mathematical demonstration to be
  open to his criticism, in the same degree as results of other kinds.
  Should he feel compelled to decide, there is no harm done: his circle may
  be 3&#x215B; times its diameter, if it please him. But we must warn him
  that, in order to get this circle, he must, as Mr. James Smith has done,
  <i>make it at home</i>: the laws of space and thought beg leave
  respectfully to decline the order."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I will insert now at length, from the <i>Athenæum</i> of June 8, 1861,
  the easy refutation given by my deceased friend, with the remarks which
  precede.</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Smith, of whose performance in the way of squaring the
  circle we spoke some weeks ago in terms short of entire acquiescence, has
  advertised himself in our columns, as our readers will have seen. He has
  also forwarded his letter to the Liverpool <i>Albion</i>, with an
  additional statement, which he did not make in <i>our</i> journal. He
  denies that he has violated the decencies of private life, since his
  correspondent revised the proofs of his own letters, and his 'protest had
  respect only to making his name public.' This statement Mr. James Smith
  precedes by saying that we have treated as true what we well knew to be
  false: and he follows by saying that we have not read his work, or we
  should have known the above facts to be true. Mr. Smith's pretext is as
  follows. His correspondent E.&nbsp;M. says, 'My letters were not intended for
  publication, and I protest against their being published,' and he
  subjoins 'Therefore I must desire that my name may not be used.' The
  obvious meaning is that E.&nbsp;M. protested against the publication
  altogether, but, judging that Mr. Smith was <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[114]</span>determined to publish,
  desired that his name should not be used. That he afterwards corrected
  the proofs merely means that he thought it wiser to let them pass under
  his own eyes than to leave them entirely to Mr. Smith.</p>

  <p>"We have received from Sir W. Rowan Hamilton<a name="NtA_209"
  href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> a proof that the circumference is
  more than 3&#x215B; diameters, requiring nothing but a knowledge of four
  books of Euclid. We give it in brief as an exercise for our juvenile
  readers to fill up. It reminds us of the old days when real geometers
  used to think it worth while seriously to demolish pretenders. Mr.
  Smith's fame is now assured: Sir W.&nbsp;R. Hamilton's brief and easy exposure
  will procure him notice in connection with this celebrated problem.</p>

  <p>"It is to be shown that the perimeter of a regular polygon of 20 sides
  is greater than 3&#x215B; diameters of the circle, and still more, of
  course, is the circumference of the circle greater than 3&#x215B;
  diameters.</p>

  <p>"1. It follows from the 4th Book of Euclid, that the rectangle under
  the side of a regular decagon inscribed in a circle, and that side
  increased by the radius, is equal to the square of the radius. But the
  product 791 (791 + 1280) is less than 1280 × 1280; if then the radius be
  1280 the side of the decagon is greater than 791.</p>

  <p>"2. When a diameter bisects a chord, the square of the chord is equal
  to the rectangle under the doubles of the segments of the diameter. But
  the product 125 (4 × 1280 - 125) is less than 791 × 791. If then the
  bisected chord be a side of the decagon, and if the radius be still 1280,
  the double of the lesser segment exceeds 125.</p>

  <p>"3. The rectangle under this doubled segment and the radius is equal
  to the square of the side of an inscribed regular polygon of 20 sides.
  But the product 125 × 1280 is equal to 400 × 400; therefore, the side of
  the last-mentioned polygon is greater than 400, if the radius be still
  1280. In other words, if the radius be represented by the new <!-- Page
  115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[115]</span>member 16,
  and therefore the diameter by 32, this side is greater than 5, and the
  perimeter exceeds 100. So that, finally, if the diameter be 8, the
  perimeter of the inscribed regular polygon of 20 sides, and still more
  the circumference of the circle, is greater than 25: that is, the
  circumference is more than 3&#x215B; diameters."</p>

  <p>The last work in the list was thus noticed in the <i>Athenæum</i>, May
  27, 1865.</p>

  <p>"Mr. James Smith appears to be tired of waiting for his place in the
  Budget of Paradoxes, and accordingly publishes a long letter to Professor
  De Morgan, with various prefaces and postscripts. The letter opens by a
  hint that the Budget appears at very long intervals, and 'apparently
  without any sufficient reason for it.' As Mr. Smith hints that he should
  like to see Mr. De Morgan, whom he calls an 'elephant of mathematics,'
  'pumping his brains' 'behind the scenes'&mdash;an odd thing for an
  elephant to do, and an odd place to do it in&mdash;to get an answer, we
  think he may mean to hint that the Budget is delayed until the pump has
  worked successfully. Mr. Smith is informed that we have had the whole
  manuscript of the Budget, excepting only a final summing-up, in our hands
  since October, 1863. [This does not refer to the Supplement.] There has
  been no delay: we knew from the beginning that a series of historical
  articles would be frequently interrupted by the things of the day. Mr.
  James Smith lets out that he has never been able to get a private line
  from Mr. De Morgan in answer to his communications: we should have
  guessed it. He says, 'The Professor is an old bird and not to be easily
  caught, and by no efforts of mine have I been able, up to the present
  moment, either to induce or twit him into a discussion....' Mr. Smith
  curtails the proverb: old birds are not to be caught with <i>chaff</i>,
  nor with <i>twit</i>, which seems to be Mr. Smith's word for his own
  chaff, and, so long as the first letter is sounded, a very proper word.
  Why does he not try a little grain of sense? Mr. Smith evidently <!--
  Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[116]</span>thinks that, in his character as an
  elephant, the Professor has not pumped up brain enough to furnish forth a
  bird. In serious earnest, Mr. Smith needs no answer. In one thing he
  excites our curiosity: what is meant by demonstrating 'geometrically
  <i>and</i> mathematically?'"</p>

  <p>I now proceed to my original treatment of the case.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Mr. James Smith will, I have no doubt, be the most uneclipsed
  circle-squarer of our day. He will not owe this distinction to his being
  an influential and respected member of the commercial world of Liverpool,
  even though the power of publishing which his means give him should
  induce him to issue a whole library upon one paradox. Neither will he owe
  it to the pains taken with him by a mathematician who corresponded with
  him until the joint letters filled an octavo volume. Neither will he owe
  it to the notice taken of him by Sir William Hamilton, of Dublin, who
  refuted him in a manner intelligible to an ordinary student of Euclid,
  which refutation he calls a remarkable paradox easily explainable, but
  without explaining it. What he will owe it to I proceed to show.</p>

  <p>Until the publication of the <i>Nut to Crack</i> Mr. James Smith stood
  among circle-squarers in general. I might have treated him with ridicule,
  as I have done others: and he says that he does not doubt he shall come
  in for his share at the tail end of my Budget. But I can make a better
  job of him than so, as Locke would have phrased it: he is such a very
  striking example of something I have said on the use of logic that I
  prefer to make an example of his writings. On one point indeed he well
  deserves the <i>scutica</i>,<a name="NtA_210"
  href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> if not the <i>horribile
  flagellum</i>.<a name="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> He
  tells me that he will bring his solution to me in such a form as shall
  compel me to admit it as <i>un fait accompli</i> [<i>une faute
  accomplie?</i>]<a name="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span>or
  leave myself open to the humiliating charge of mathematical ignorance and
  folly. He has also honored me with some private letters. In the first of
  these he gives me a "piece of information," after which he cannot imagine
  that I, "as an honest mathematician," can possibly have the slightest
  hesitation in admitting his solution. There is a tolerable reservoir of
  modest assurance in a man who writes to a perfect stranger with what he
  takes for an argument, and gives an oblique threat of imputation of
  dishonesty in case the argument be not admitted without hesitation; not
  to speak of the minor charges of ignorance and folly. All this is blind
  self-confidence, without mixture of malicious meaning; and I rather like
  it: it makes me understand how Sam Johnson came to say of his old friend
  Mrs. Cobb,<a name="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>&mdash;"I
  love Moll Cobb for her impudence." I have now done with my friend's
  <i>suaviter in modo</i>,<a name="NtA_214"
  href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> and proceed to his <i>fortiter in
  re</i><a name="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>: I shall show
  that he <i>has</i> convicted himself of ignorance and folly, with an
  honesty and candor worthy of a better value of <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith's method of proving that every circle is 3&#x215B; diameters
  is to assume that it is so,&mdash;"if you dislike the term datum, then,
  by hypothesis, let 8 circumferences be exactly equal to 25
  diameters,"&mdash;and then to show that every other supposition is
  thereby made absurd. The right to this assumption is enforced in the
  "Nut" by the following analogy:</p>

  <p>"I think you (!) will not dare (!) to dispute my right to this
  hypothesis, when I can prove by means of it that every other value of
  <span class="grk">&pi;</span> will lead to the grossest absurdities;
  unless indeed, you are prepared to dispute the right of Euclid to adopt a
  false line hypothetically for the purpose <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[118]</span>of a '<i>reductio ad
  absurdum</i>'<a name="NtA_216" href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a>
  demonstration, in pure geometry."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Euclid assumes what he wants to <i>disprove</i>, and shows that his
  <i>assumption</i> leads to absurdity, and so <i>upsets itself</i>. Mr.
  Smith assumes what he wants to <i>prove</i>, and shows that <i>his</i>
  assumption makes <i>other propositions</i> lead to absurdity. This is
  enough for all who can reason. Mr. James Smith cannot be argued with; he
  has the whip-hand of all the thinkers in the world. Montucla would have
  said of Mr. Smith what he said of the gentleman who squared his circle by
  giving 50 and 49 the same square root, <i>Il a perdu le droit d'être
  frappé de l'évidence</i>.<a name="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is Mr. Smith's habit, when he finds a conclusion agreeing with its
  own assumption, to regard that agreement as proof of the assumption. The
  following is the "piece of information" which will settle me, if I be
  honest. Assuming <span class="grk">&pi;</span> to be 3&#x215B;, he finds
  out by working instance after instance that the mean proportional between
  one-fifth of the area and one-fifth of eight is the radius. That is,</p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>

  <p>We naturally ask what sort of glimmer can Mr. Smith have of the
  subject which he professes to treat? On this point he has given
  satisfactory information. I had mentioned the old problem of finding two
  mean proportionals, <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>[119]</span>as a preliminary to the duplication of the
  cube. On this mention Mr. Smith writes as follows. I put a few words in
  capitals; and I write <i>rq</i><a name="NtA_218"
  href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> for the sign of the square root,
  which embarrasses small type:</p>

  <p>"This establishes the following <i>infallible</i> rule, for finding
  two mean proportionals <span class="scac">OF EQUAL VALUE</span>, and is
  more than a preliminary, to the famous old problem of 'Squaring the
  circle.' Let any finite number, say 20, and its fourth part = ¼(20) = 5,
  be given numbers. Then <i>rq</i>(20 × 5) = <i>rq</i> 100 = 10, is their
  mean proportional. Let this be a given mean proportional <span
  class="scac">TO FIND ANOTHER MEAN PROPORTIONAL OF EQUAL VALUE</span>.
  Then</p>

  <p>will be the second number; therefore <i>rq</i>(15.625 × 6.4) =

  Sir, however competent you may be to prove every man a fool [not
  <i>every</i> man, Mr. Smith! only <i>some</i>; pray learn logical
  quantification] who now thinks, or in times gone by has thought, the
  'Squaring of the Circle' <i>a possibility</i>; I doubt, and, on the
  evidence afforded by your Budget, I cannot help doubting, whether you
  were ever before competent to find two mean proportionals <i>by my unique
  method</i>."&mdash;(<i>Nut</i>, pp. 47, 48.) [That I never was, I
  solemnly declare!]</p>

  <p>All readers can be made to see the following exposure. When 5 and 20
  are given, <i>x</i> is a mean proportional when in 5, <i>x</i>, 20, 5 is
  to <i>x</i> as <i>x</i> to 20. And <i>x</i> must be 10. But <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> are <i>two</i> mean proportionals when in 5, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
  20, <i>x</i> <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>[120]</span>is a mean proportional between 5 and
  <i>y</i>, and <i>y</i> is a mean proportional between <i>x</i> and 20.
  And these means are <i>x</i> = 5 ³&radic;4, <i>y</i> = 5 ³&radic;16. But
  Mr. Smith finds <i>one</i> mean, finds it <i>again</i> in a roundabout
  way, and produces 10 and 10 as the two (equal!) means, in solution of the
  "famous old problem." This is enough: if more were wanted, there is more
  where this came from. Let it not be forgotten that Mr. Smith has found a
  translator abroad, two, perhaps three, followers at home, and&mdash;most
  surprising of all&mdash;a real mathematician to try to set him right. And
  this mathematician did not discover the character of the subsoil of the
  land he was trying to cultivate until a goodly octavo volume of letters
  had passed and repassed. I have noticed, in more quarters than one, an
  apparent want of perception of the <i>full</i> amount of Mr. Smith's
  ignorance: persons who have not been in contact with the non-geometrical
  circle-squarers have a kind of doubt as to whether anybody can carry
  things so far. But I am an "old bird" as Mr. Smith himself calls me; a
  Simorg, an "all-knowing Bird of Ages" in matters of cyclometry.</p>

  <p>The curious phenomena of thought here exhibited illustrate, as above
  said, a remark I have long ago made on the effect of proper study of
  logic. Most persons reason well enough on matter to which they are
  accustomed, and in terms with which they are familiar. But in
  unaccustomed matter, and with use of strange terms, few except those who
  are practised in the abstractions of pure logic can be tolerably sure to
  keep their feet. And one of the reasons is easily stated: terms which are
  not quite familiar partake of the vagueness of the X and Y on which the
  student of logic learns to see the formal force of a proposition
  independently of its material elements.</p>

  <p>I make the following quotation from my fourth paper on logic in the
  <i>Cambridge Transactions</i>:</p>

  <p>"The uncultivated reason proceeds by a process almost entirely
  material. Though the necessary law of thought <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[121]</span>must determine the
  conclusion of the ploughboy as much as that of Aristotle himself, the
  ploughboy's conclusion will only be tolerably sure when the matter of it
  is such as comes within his usual cognizance. He knows that geese being
  all birds does not make all birds geese, but mainly because there are
  ducks, chickens, partridges, etc. A beginner in geometry, when asked what
  follows from 'Every A is B,' answers 'Every B is A.' That is, the
  necessary laws of thought, except in minds which have examined their
  tools, are not very sure to work correct conclusions except upon familiar
  matter.... As the cultivation of the individual increases, the laws of
  thought which are of most usual application are applied to familiar
  matter with tolerable safety. But difficulty and risk of error make a new
  appearance with a new subject; and this, in most cases, until new
  subjects are familiar things, unusual matter common, untried nomenclature
  habitual; that is, until it is a habit to be occupied upon a novelty. It
  is observed that many persons reason well in some things and badly in
  others; and this is attributed to the consequence of employing the mind
  too much upon one or another subject. But those who know the truth of the
  preceding remarks will not have far to seek for what is often, perhaps
  most often, the true reason.... I maintain that logic tends to make the
  power of reason over the unusual and unfamiliar more nearly equal to the
  power over the usual and familiar than it would otherwise be. The second
  is increased; but the first is almost created."</p>

  <p>Mr. James Smith, by bringing ignorance, folly, dishonesty into contact
  with my name, in the way of conditional insinuation, has done me a good
  turn: he has given me right to a freedom of personal remark which I might
  have declined to take in the case of a person who is useful and respected
  in matters which he understands.</p>

  <p>Tit for tat is logic all the world over. By the way, what has become
  of the rest of the maxim: we never hear it <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span>now. When I was a boy,
  in some parts of the country at least, it ran thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tit for tat;</p>
      <p>Butter for fat:</p>
      <p>If you kill my dog,</p>
      <p>I'll kill your cat."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He is a glaring instance of the truth of the observations quoted
  above. I will answer for it that, at the Mersey Dock Board, he never
  dreams of proving that the balance at the banker's is larger than that in
  the book by assuming that the larger sum is there, and then proving that
  the other supposition&mdash;the smaller balance&mdash;is upon that
  assumption, an absurdity. He never says to another director, How can you
  dare to refuse me a right to assume the larger balance, when you
  yourself, the other day, said,&mdash;Suppose, for argument's sake, we had
  80,000<i>l.</i> at the banker's, though you knew the book only showed
  30,000<i>l.</i>? This is the way in which he has supported his
  geometrical paradox by Euclid's example: and this is not the way he
  reasons at the board; I know it by the character of him as a man of
  business which has reached my ears from several quarters. But in geometry
  and rational arithmetic he is a smatterer, though expert at computation;
  at the board he is a trained man of business. The language of geometry is
  so new to him that he does not know what is meant by "two mean
  proportionals:" but all the phrases of commerce are rooted in his mind.
  He is most unerasably booked in the history of the squaring of the
  circle, as the speculator who took a right to assume a proposition for
  the destruction of other propositions, on the express ground that Euclid
  assumes a proposition to show that it destroys itself: which is as if the
  curate should demand permission to throttle the squire because St.
  Patrick drove the vermin to suicide to save themselves from slaughter. He
  is conspicuous as a speculator who, more visibly than almost any other
  known to history, reasoned in a circle by way of reasoning on a circle.
  But <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span>what I have chiefly to do with is the
  force of instance which he has lent to my assertion that men who have not
  had real training in pure logic are unsafe reasoners in matter which is
  not familiar. It is hard to get first-rate examples of this, because
  there are few who find the way to the printer until practice and
  reflection have given security against the grossest slips. I cannot but
  think that his case will lead many to take what I have said into
  consideration, among those who are competent to think of the great mental
  disciplines. To this end I should desire him to continue his efforts, to
  amplify and develop his great principle, that of proving a proposition by
  assuming it and taking as confirmation every consequence that does not
  contradict the assumption.</p>

  <p>Since my Budget commenced, Mr. Smith has written me notes: the portion
  which I have preserved&mdash;I suppose several have been
  mislaid&mdash;makes a hundred and seven pages of note-paper, closely
  written. To all this I have not answered one word: but I think I cannot
  have read fewer than forty pages. In the last letter the writer informs
  me that he will not write at greater length until I have given him an
  answer, according to the "rules of good society." Did I not know that for
  every inch I wrote back he would return an ell? Surely in vain the net is
  spread in the eyes of anything that hath a wing. There were several good
  excuses for not writing to Mr. J. Smith: I will mention five. First, I
  distinctly announced at the beginning of this Budget that I would not
  communicate with squarers of the circle. Secondly, any answer I might
  choose to give might with perfect propriety be reserved for this article;
  had the imputation of incivility been made after the first note, I should
  immediately have replied to this effect: but I presumed it was quite
  understood. Thirdly, Mr. Smith, by his publication of E.&nbsp;M.'s letters
  against the wish of the writer, had put himself out of the pale of
  correspondence. Fourthly, he had also gone beyond the rules of good
  society in sending <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>[124]</span>letter after letter to a person who had
  shown by his silence an intention to avoid correspondence. Fifthly, these
  same rules of good society are contrived to be flexible or frangible in
  extreme cases: otherwise there would be no living under them; and good
  society would be bad. Father Aldrovand has laid down the necessary
  distinction&mdash;"I tell thee, thou foolish Fleming, the text speaketh
  but of promises made unto Christians, and there is in the rubric a
  special exemption of such as are made to Welchmen." There is also a
  rubric to the rules of good society; and squarers of the circle are among
  those whom there is special permission not to answer: they are the wild
  Welchmen of geometry, who are always assailing, but never taking, the
  Garde Douloureuse<a name="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> of
  the circle. "At this commentary," proceeds the story, "the Fleming
  grinned so broadly as to show his whole case of broad strong white
  teeth." I know not whether the Welchman would have done the like, but I
  hope Mr. James Smith will: and I hope he has as good a case to show as
  Wilkin Flammock. For I wish him long life and long health, and should be
  very glad to see so much energy employed in a productive way. I hope he
  wishes me the same: if not, I will give him what all his judicious
  friends will think a good reason for doing so. His pamphlets and letters
  are all tied up together, and will form a curious lot when death or
  cessation of power to forage among book-shelves shall bring my little
  library to the hammer. And this time may not be far off: for I was X
  years old in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> X<sup>2</sup>; not 4 in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 16, nor 5 in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 25,
  but still in one case under that law. And now I have made my own age a
  problem of quadrature, and Mr. J. Smith may solve it. But I protest
  against his method of assuming a result, and making itself prove itself:
  he might in this way, as sure as eggs is eggs (a corruption of X is X),
  make me 1,864 years old, which is a great deal too much.</p>

<p><!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[125]</span></p>

  <p><i>April 5, 1864.</i>&mdash;Mr. Smith continues to write me long
  letters, to which he hints that I am to answer. In his last, of 31
  closely written sides of note-paper, he informs me, with reference to my
  obstinate silence, that though I think myself and am thought by others to
  be a mathematical Goliath, I have resolved to play the mathematical
  snail, and keep within my shell. A mathematical <i>snail</i>! This cannot
  be the thing so called which regulates the striking of a clock; for it
  would mean that I am to make Mr. Smith sound the true time of day, which
  I would by no means undertake upon a clock that gains 19 seconds odd in
  every hour by false quadrature. But he ventures to tell me that pebbles
  from the sling of simple truth and common sense will ultimately crack my
  shell, and put me <i>hors de combat</i>.<a name="NtA_220"
  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> The confusion of images is amusing:
  Goliath turning himself into a snail to avoid <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3&#x215B;, and James Smith, Esq., of the Mersey
  Dock Board: and put <i>hors de combat</i>&mdash;which should have been
  <i>caché</i><a name="NtA_221"
  href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a>&mdash;by pebbles from a sling. If
  Goliath had crept into a snail-shell, David would have cracked the
  Philistine with his foot. There is something like modesty in the
  implication that the crack-shell pebble has not yet taken effect; it
  might have been thought that the slinger would by this time have been
  singing&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And thrice [and one-eighth] I routed all my foes,</p>
      <p>And thrice [and one-eighth] I slew the slain."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But he promises to give the public his nut-cracker if I do not, before
  the Budget is concluded, "unravel" the paradox, which is the
  mathematico-geometrical nut he has given me to crack. Mr. Smith is a
  crack man: he will crack his own nut; he will crack my shell; in the mean
  time he cracks himself up. Heaven send he do not crack himself into
  lateral contiguity with himself.</p>

  <p>On June 27 I received a letter, in the handwriting of Mr. James Smith,
  signed Nauticus. I have ascertained <!-- Page 126 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[126]</span>that one of the letters
  to the <i>Athenæum</i> signed Nauticus is in the same handwriting. I make
  a few extracts:</p>

  <p>"... The important question at issue has been treated by a brace of
  mathematical birds with too much levity. It may be said, however, that
  sarcasm and ridicule sometimes succeed, where reason fails.... Such a
  course is not well suited to a discussion.... For this reason I shall for
  the future [this implies there has been a past, so that Nauticus is not
  before me for the first time] endeavor to confine myself to dry reasoning
  from incontrovertible premises.</p>

  <p>... It appears to me that so far as his theory is concerned he comes
  off unscathed. You might have found "a hole in Smith's circle" (have you
  seen a pamphlet bearing this title? [I never heard of it until now]), but
  after all it is quite possible the hole may have been left by design, for
  the purpose of entrapping the unwary."</p>

  <p>[On the publication of the above, the author of the pamphlet
  obligingly forwarded a copy to me of <i>A Hole in Smith's
  Circle</i>&mdash;by a Cantab: Longman and Co., 1859, (pp. 15). "It is
  pity to lose any fun we can get out of the affair," says my almamaternal
  brother: to which I add that in such a case warning without joke is worse
  than none at all, as giving a false idea of the nature of the danger. The
  Cantab takes some absurdities on which I have not dwelt: but there are
  enough to afford a Cantab from every college his own separate hunting
  ground.]</p>

  <p>Does this hint that his mode of proof, namely, assuming the thing to
  be proved, was a design to entrap the unwary? if so, it bangs Banagher.
  Was his confounding two mean proportionals with one mean proportional
  found twice over a trick of the same intent? if so, it beats
  cockfighting. That Nauticus is Mr. Smith appears from other internal
  evidence. In 1819, Mr. J.&nbsp;C. Hobhouse<a name="NtA_222"
  href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> was sent to Newgate for a <!-- Page
  127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[127]</span>libel on
  the House of Commons which was only intended for a libel on Lord
  Erskine.<a name="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> The
  ex-Chancellor had taken Mr. Hobhouse to be thinking of him in a certain
  sentence; this Mr. Hobhouse denied, adding, "There is but one man in the
  country who is always thinking of Lord Erskine." I say that there is but
  one man of our day who would couple me and Mr. James Smith as a "brace of
  mathematical birds."</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith's "theory" is unscathed by me. Not a doubt about it: but how
  does he himself come off? I should never think of refuting a theory
  proved by assumption of itself. I left Mr. Smith's <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> untouched: or, if I put in my thumb <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `und'">and</span> pulled out a plum,
  it was to give a notion of the cook, not of the dish. The "important
  question at issue" was not the circle: it was, wholly and solely, whether
  the abbreviation of <i>James</i> might be spelled <i>Jimm</i>.<a
  name="NtA_224" href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> This is personal to
  the verge of scurrility: but in literary controversy the challenger names
  the weapons, and Mr. Smith begins with charge of ignorance, folly, and
  dishonesty, by conditional implication. So that the question is, not the
  personality of a word, but its applicability to the person designated: it
  is enough if, as the Latin grammar has it, <i>Verbum personale concordat
  cum nominativo</i>.<a name="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I may plead precedent for taking a liberty with the orthography of
  <i>Jem</i>. An instructor of youth was scandalized at the abrupt and
  irregular&mdash;but very effective&mdash;opening of Wordsworth's little
  piece:</p>

<p><!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[128]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"A simple child</p>
      <p>That lightly draws its breath,</p>
      <p>And feels its life in every limb,</p>
      <p>What should it know of death?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So he mended the matter by instructing his pupils to read the first
  line thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A simple child, dear brother &mdash;&mdash;."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The brother, we infer from sound, was to be James, and the blank must
  therefore be filled up with <i>Jimb</i>.</p>

  <p>I will notice one point of the letter, to make a little more
  distinction between the two birds. Nauticus lays down&mdash;quite
  correctly&mdash;that the sine of an angle is less than its circular
  measure. He then takes 3.1416 for 180°, and finds that 36' is .010472.
  But this is exactly what he finds for the sine of 36' in tables: he
  concludes that either 3.1416 or the tables must be wrong. He does not
  know that sines, as well as <span class="grk">&pi;</span>, are
  interminable decimals, of which the tables, to save printing, only take
  in a finite number. He is a six-figure man: let us go thrice again to
  make up nine, and we have as follows:</p>

<table class="nob">
<tr><td>Circular measure of 36'</td><td>.010471975...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sine of 36'</td><td>.010471784...</td></tr>
<tr><td>Excess of measure over sine &nbsp; </td><td>.000000191...</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Mr. Smith invites me to say which is wrong, the quadrature, or the
  tables: I leave him to guess. He says his assertions "arise naturally and
  necessarily out of the arguments of a circle-squarer:" he might just as
  well lay down that all the pigs went to market because it is recorded
  that "<i>This</i> pig went to market." I must say for circle-squarers
  that very few bring their pigs to so poor a market. I answer the above
  argument because it is, of all which Mr. James Smith has produced, the
  only one which rises to the level of a schoolboy: to meet him halfway I
  descend to that level.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith asks me to solve a problem in the <i>Athenæum</i>: <!-- Page
  129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>[129]</span>and I will
  do it, because the question will illustrate what is <i>below</i>
  schoolboy level.</p>

  <p>"Let <i>x</i> represent the circular measure of an angle of 15°, and
  <i>y</i> half the sine of an angle of 30° = area of the square on the
  radius of a circle of diameter unity = .25. If <i>x</i> - <i>y</i> =
  <i>xy</i>, firstly, what is the arithmetical value of <i>xy</i>?
  secondly, what is the angle of which <i>xy</i> represents the circular
  measure?"</p>

  <p>If <i>x</i> represent 15° and <i>y</i> be ¼, <i>xy</i> represents 3°
  45', whether <i>x</i> - <i>y</i> be <i>xy</i> or no. But, <i>y</i> being
  ¼, <i>x</i> - <i>y</i> is <i>not</i> <i>xy</i> unless <i>x</i> be
  &#x2153;, that is, unless 12<i>x</i> or <span class="grk">&pi;</span> be
  4, which Mr. Smith would not admit. How could a person who had just
  received such a lesson as I had given immediately pray for further
  exposure, furnishing the stuff so liberally as this? Is it possible that
  Mr. Smith, because he signs himself Nauticus, means to deny his own very
  regular, legible, and peculiar hand? It is enough to make the other
  members of the Liverpool Dock Board cry, Mersey on the man!</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith says that for the future he will give up what he calls
  sarcasm, and confine himself, "as far as possible," to what he calls dry
  reasoning from incontrovertible premises. If I have fairly taught him
  that <i>his</i> sarcasm will not succeed, I hope he will find that his
  wit's end is his logic's beginning.</p>

  <p>I now reply to a question I have been asked again and again since my
  last Budget appeared: Why do you take so much trouble to expose such a
  reasoner as Mr. Smith? I answer as a deceased friend of mine used to
  answer on like occasions&mdash;A man's capacity is no measure of his
  power to do mischief. Mr. Smith has untiring energy, which does
  something; self-evident honesty of conviction, which does more; and a
  long purse, which does most of all. He has made at least ten
  publications, full of figures which few readers can criticize. A great
  many people are staggered to this extent, that they imagine there must be
  <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>[130]</span>the indefinite <i>something</i> in the
  mysterious <i>all this</i>. They are brought to the point of suspicion
  that the mathematicians ought not to treat "all this" with such
  undisguised contempt, at least. Now I have no fear for <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>: but I do think it possible that general opinion
  might in time demand that the crowd of circle-squarers, etc. should be
  admitted to the honors of opposition; and this would be a time-tax of
  five per cent., one man with another, upon those who are better employed.
  Mr. James Smith may be made useful, in hands which understand how to do
  it, towards preventing such opinion from growing. A speculator who
  expressly assumes what he wants to prove, and argues that all which
  contradicts it is absurd, <i>because</i> it cannot stand side by side
  with his assumption, is a case which can be exposed to all. And the best
  person to expose it is one who has lived in the past as well as the
  present, who takes misthinking from points of view which none but a
  student of history can occupy, and who has something of a turn for the
  business.</p>

  <p>Whether I have any motive but public good must be referred to those
  who can decide whether a missionary chooses his pursuit solely to convert
  the heathen. I shall certainly be thought to have a little of the spirit
  of Col. Quagg, who delighted in strapping the Grace-walking Brethren. I
  must quote this myself: if I do not, some one else will, and then where
  am I? The Colonel's principle is described as follows:</p>

  <p>"I licks ye because I kin, and because I like, and because ye'se
  critters that licks is good for. Skins ye have on, and skins I'll have
  off; hard or soft, wet or dry, spring or fall. Walk in grace if ye like
  till pumpkins is peaches; but licked ye must be till your toe-nails drop
  off and your noses bleed blue ink.
  And&mdash;licked&mdash;they&mdash;were&mdash;accordingly."</p>

  <p>I am reminded of this by the excessive confidence with which Mr. James
  Smith predicted that he would treat me as Zephaniah Stockdolloger (Sam
  Slick calls it <i>slockdollager</i>) treated Goliah Quagg. He has
  announced his <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>[131]</span>intention of bringing me, with a contrite
  heart, and clean shaved,&mdash;4159265... razored down to 25,&mdash;to a
  camp-meeting of circle-squarers. But there is this difference: Zephaniah
  only wanted to pass the Colonel's smithy in peace; Mr. James Smith sought
  a fight with me. As soon as this Budget began to appear, he oiled his own
  strap, and attempted to treat me as the terrible Colonel would have
  treated the inoffensive brother.</p>

  <p>He is at liberty to try again.</p>

  <p>A Correspondent, who is evidently fully master of details, which he

  <i>New York Sun</i>, of which R.&nbsp;A. Locke was editor. It so much
  resembled a story then recently published by Edgar A. Poe, in a Southern
  paper, "Adventures of Hans Pfaal," that some New York journals published
  the two side by side. Mr. Locke, when he left the <i>New York Sun</i>,
  started another paper, and discovered the manuscript of Mungo Park;<a
  name="NtA_232" href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> but this did not
  deceive. The <i>Sun</i>, however, continued its career, and had a great
  success in an account of a balloon voyage from England to America, in

  href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> written in a way which marks the
  practised observatory astronomer beyond all doubt, and by evidence seen
  in the most minute details. Nicollet had an eye to Europe. I suspect that
  he took Poe's story, and made it a basis for his own. Mr. Locke, it would
  seem, when he attempted a fabrication for himself, did not succeed.</p>

<p class="cenhead">IMPALEMENT BY REQUEST.</p>

  <p><i>Athenæum</i>, August, 19, 1865. <i>Notice to
  Correspondents.</i></p>

  <p>"R.&nbsp;W.&mdash;If you will consult the opening chapter of the Budget of
  Paradoxes, you will see that the author presents only works in his own
  library at a given date; and this for a purpose explained. For ourselves
  we have carefully avoided allowing any writers to present themselves in
  our columns on the ground that the Budget has passed them over. We gather
  that Mr. De Morgan contemplates additions at a future time, perhaps in a
  separate and augmented work; if so, those who complain that others of no
  greater claims than themselves have been ridiculed may find themselves
  where they wish to be. We have done what we can for you by forwarding
  your letter to Mr. De Morgan."</p>

  <p>The author of "An Essay on the Constitution of the Earth," published
  in 1844, demanded of the <i>Athenæum</i>, as an <i>act of fairness</i>,
  that a letter from him should be published, proving that he had as much
  right to be "impaled" as Capt. Drayson. He holds, on speculative grounds,
  what the other claims to have proved by measurement, namely, that the
  earth is growing; and he believes that in time&mdash;a good long time,
  not <i>our</i> time&mdash;the earth and other planets may grow into suns,
  with systems of their own.</p>

  <p>This gentleman sent me a copy of his work, after the commencement of
  my Budget; but I have no recollection of having received it, and I cannot
  find it on the (nursery? <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>[134]</span>quarantine?) shelves on which I keep my
  unestablished discoveries. Had I known of this work in time, (see the
  Introduction) I should of course, have impaled it (heraldically) with the
  other work; but the two are very different. Capt. Drayson professes to
  prove his point by results of observation; and I think he does not
  succeed. The author before me only speculates; and a speculator can get
  any conclusion into his premises, if he will only build or hire them of
  shape and size to suit. It reminds me of a statement I heard years ago,
  that a score of persons, or near it, were to dine inside the skull of one
  of the aboriginal animals, dear little creatures! Whereat I wondered
  vastly, nothing doubting; facts being stubborn and not easy drove, as
  Mrs. Gamp said. But I soon learned that the skull was not a real one, but
  artificially constructed by the methods&mdash;methods which have had
  striking verifications, too&mdash;which enable zoologists to go the whole
  hog by help of a toe or a bit of tail. This took off the edge of the
  wonder: a hundred people can dine inside an inference, if you draw it
  large enough. The method might happen to fail for once: for instance, the
  toe-bone might have been abnormalized by therian or saurian malady; and
  the possibility of such failure, even when of small probability, is of
  great alleviation. The author before me is, apparently, the sole
  fabricator of his own premises. With vital force in the earth and
  continual creation on the part of the original Creator, he expands our
  bit of a residence as desired. But, as the Newtoness of Cookery observed,
  First catch your hare. When this is done, when you <i>have</i> a growing
  earth, you shall dress it with all manner of proximate causes, and serve
  it up with a growing Moon for sauce, a growing Sun, if it please you, at
  the other end, and growing planets for side-dishes. Hoping this amount of
  impalement will be satisfactory, I go on to something else. <!-- Page 135

  <p>A useful collection on the history of the attempts at perpetual

  <p>There is a paradox of which I ought to give a specimen, I mean the
  <i>slander-paradox</i>; the case of a person who takes it into his head,
  upon evidence furnished entirely by the workings of his own thoughts,
  that some other person has committed a foul act of which the world at
  large would no more suppose him guilty than they would suppose that the
  earth is a flat bordered by ice. If I were to determine on giving cases
  in which the self-deluded person imagines <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[139]</span>a conspiracy against
  <i>himself</i>, there would be no end of choices. Many of the grosser
  cases are found at last to be accompanied by mental disorder, and it is
  difficult to avoid referring the whole class to something different from
  simple misuse of the reasoning power. The first instance is one which
  puts in a strong light the state of things in which we live, brought
  about by our glorious freedom of thought, speech, and writing. The
  Government treated it with neglect, the press with silent contempt, and I
  will answer for it many of my readers now hear of it for the first time,
  when it comes to be enrolled among circle-squarers and earth-stoppers,
  where, as the old philosopher said, it will not gravitate, being <i>in
  proprio loco</i>.<a name="NtA_246"

  <p>1862. On new year's day, 1862, when the nation was in the full tide of
  sympathy with the Queen, and regret for its own loss, a paper called the
  <i>Free Press</i> published a number devoted to the consideration of the
  causes of the death of the Prince Consort. It is so rambling and
  inconsecutive that it takes more than one reading to understand it. It is
  against the <i>Times</i> newspaper. First, the following insinuation:</p>

  <p>"To the legal mind, the part of [the part taken by] the <i>Times</i>
  will present a <i>prima facie</i> case of the gravest nature, in the
  evident fore-knowledge of the event, and the preparation to turn it to
  account when it should have occurred. The article printed on Saturday
  must have been written on Friday. That article could not have appeared
  had the Prince been intended to live."</p>

  <p>Next, it is affirmed that the <i>Times</i> intended to convey the idea
  that the Prince had been poisoned.</p>

  <p>"Up to this point we are merely dealing with words which the
  <i>Times</i> publishes, and these can leave not a shadow of doubt that
  there is an intention to promulgate the idea that Prince Albert had been
  poisoned."</p>

  <p>The article then goes on with a strange olio of <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[140]</span>insinuations to the
  effect that the Prince was the obstacle to Russian intrigue, and that if
  he should have been poisoned,&mdash;which the writer strongly hints may
  have been the case,&mdash;some Minister under the influence of Russia
  must have done it. Enough for this record. <i>Un sot trouve toujours un

<p class="cenhead">THE NEPTUNE CONTROVERSY.</p>

  <p>1846. At the end of this year arose the celebrated controversy
  relative to the discovery of Neptune. Those who know it are well aware
  that Mr. Adams's<a name="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> now
  undoubted right to rank with Le Verrier<a name="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> was made sure at the very outset by
  the manner in which Mr. Airy,<a name="NtA_250"
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> the Astronomer Royal, came forward to
  state what had taken place between himself and Mr. Adams. Those who know
  all the story about Mr. Airy being arrested in his progress by the
  neglect of Mr. Adams to answer a letter, with all the imputations which
  might have been thrown upon himself for laxity in the matter, know also
  that Mr. Airy's conduct exhibited moral courage, honest feeling, and
  willingness to sacrifice himself, if need were, to the attainment of the
  ends of private justice, and the establishment of a national claim. A
  writer in a magazine, in a long and elaborate article, argued the
  supposition&mdash;put in every way except downright assertion, after the
  fashion of such things&mdash;that Mr. Airy had communicated Mr. Adams's
  results to M. Le Verrier, with intention that they should be used. His
  presumption as to motive is that, had Mr. Adams been recognized, "then
  the discovery must have been indisputably an <i>Englishman's</i>, and
  that Englishman not the Astronomer Royal." Mr. Adams's conclusions were
  "retouched in France, and sent <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page141"></a>[141]</span>over the year after." The proof given is
  that it cannot be "imagined" otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Can it then be imagined that the Astronomer Royal received such
  results from Mr. Adams, supported as they were by Professor Challis's<a
  name="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> valuable testimony as
  to their probable accuracy, and did not bring the French astronomer
  acquainted with them, especially as he was aware that his friend was
  engaged in matters bearing directly upon these results?"</p>

  <p>The whole argument the author styles "evidence which I consider it
  difficult to refute." He ends by calling upon certain persons, of whom I
  am one, to "see ample justice done." This is the duty of every one,
  according to his opportunities. So when the reputed author&mdash;the
  article being anonymous&mdash;was, in 1849, proposed as a Fellow of the
  Astronomical Society, I joined&mdash;if I remember right, I
  originated&mdash;an opposition to his election, until either the
  authorship should be denied, or a proper retraction made. The friends of
  the author neither denied the first, nor produced the second: and they
  judged it prudent to withdraw the proposal. Had I heard of any subsequent
  repentance, I would have taken some other instance, instead of this:
  should I yet hear of such a thing, I will take care to notice it in the
  continuation of this list, which I confidently expect, life and health
  permitting, to be able to make in a few years. This much may be said,
  that the author, in a lecture on the subject, given in 1849, and
  published with his name, did <i>not</i> repeat the charge.</p>

  <p>[The libel was published in the <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i>,<a
  name="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> (vol. for 1846, pp.
  604-615): and the editor supported it as follows, (vol. for 1847, p.
  476). In answer to Mr. Sheepshanks's charitable hope that he had been
  hoaxed, <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>[142]</span>he says: "Mr. Sheepshanks cannot certainly
  have read the article referred to.... Severe and inculpatory it
  is&mdash;unjust some may deem it (though we ourselves are out of the
  number.)... A 'hoax' forsooth! May we be often the dupes of such hoaxes!"
  He then goes on to describe the article as directed against the
  Astronomer Royal's alleged neglect to give Mr. Adams that "encouragement
  and protection" which was his due, and <i>does not hint one word</i>
  about the article containing the charge of having secretly and
  fraudulently transmitted news of Mr. Adams's researches to France, that
  an Englishman might not have the honor of the discovery. Mr. Sheepshanks
  having called this a "deliberate calumny," without a particle of proof or
  probability to support it, the editor says "what the reverend gentleman
  means by this, we are at a loss to understand." He then proceeds
  <i>not</i> to remember. I repeat here, what I have said elsewhere, that
  the management of the journal has changed hands; but from 1846 to 1856,
  it had the collar of S.S. (scientific slander). The prayer for more such
  things was answered (See p. 349).]</p>

<p class="cenhead">JAMES IVORY.<a name="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I have said that those who are possessed with the idea of conspiracy
  against themselves are apt to imagine both conspirators and their bad
  motives and actions. A person who should take up the idea of combination
  against himself without feeling ill-will and originating accusations
  would be indeed a paradox. But such a paradox has existed. It is very
  well known, both in and beyond the scientific world, that the late James
  Ivory was subject to the <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page143"></a>[143]</span>impression of which I am speaking; and the
  diaries and other sources of anecdote of our day will certainly, sooner
  or later, make it a part of his biography. The consequence will be that
  to his memory will be attached the unfavorable impression which the usual
  conduct of such persons creates; unless it should happen that some one
  who knows the real state of the case puts the two sides of it properly
  together. Ivory was of that note in the scientific world which may be
  guessed from Laplace's description of him as the first geometer in
  Britain and one of the first in Europe. Being in possession of accurate
  knowledge of his peculiarity in more cases than one; and in one case
  under his own hand: and having been able to make full inquiry about him,
  especially from my friend the late Thomas Galloway<a name="NtA_254"
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>&mdash;who came after him at
  Sandhurst&mdash;one of the few persons with whom he was intimate:&mdash;I
  have decided, after full deliberation, to forestall the future
  biographies.</p>

  <p>That Ivory was haunted by the fear of which I have spoken, to the
  fullest extent, came to my own public and official knowledge, as
  Secretary of the Astronomical Society. It was the duty of Mr. Epps,<a
  name="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> the Assistant
  Secretary, at the time when Francis Baily<a name="NtA_256"
  href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> first announced his discovery of the
  Flamsteed Papers, to report to me that Mr. Ivory had called at the
  Society's apartments to inquire into the contents of those papers, and to
  express his hope that Mr. Baily was not attacking living persons under
  the names of Newton and Flamsteed.<a name="NtA_257"
  href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> Mr. Galloway, to whom I communicated
  this, immediately went to Mr. Ivory, and succeeded, after some
  explanation, in setting him right. This is but one of many instances in
  which a man of thoroughly sound judgment in every other respect seemed to
  be under a complete chain of delusions about the conduct of <!-- Page 144
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>[144]</span>others to
  himself. But the paradox is this:&mdash;I never could learn that Ivory,
  passing his life under the impression that secret and unprovoked enemies
  were at work upon his character, ever originated a charge, imputed a bad
  motive, or allowed himself an uncourteous expression. Some letters of
  his, now in my possession, referring to a private matter, are, except in
  the main impression on which they proceed, unobjectionable in every
  point: they might have been written by a cautious friend, whose object
  was, if possible, to prevent a difference from becoming a duel without
  compromising his principal's rights or character. Knowing that in some
  quarters the knowledge of Ivory's peculiarity is more or less connected
  with a notion that the usual consequences followed, I think the preceding
  statement due to his memory.</p>

<p class="cenhead">THREE CLASSES OF JOURNALS.</p>

  <p>In such a record as the present, which mixes up the grossest
  speculative absurdities with every degree of what is better, an instance
  of another kind may find an appropriate place. The faults of journalism,
  when merely exposed by other journalism pass by and are no more regarded.
  A distinct account of an undeniable meanness, recorded in a work of
  amusement and reference both, may have its use: such a thing may act as a
  warning. An editor who is going to indulge his private grudge may be
  prevented from counting upon oblivion as a matter of certainty.</p>

  <p>There are three kinds of journals, with reference to the mode of
  entrance of contributors. First, as a thing which has been, but which now
  hardly exists, there is the journal in which the editor receives a fixed
  sum to <i>find the matter</i>. In such a journal, every article which the
  editor can get a friend to give him is so much in his own pocket, which
  has a great tendency to lower the character of the articles; but I am not
  concerned with this point. Secondly, there is the journal which is
  supported by voluntary contributions of <!-- Page 145 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[145]</span>matter, the editor
  selecting. Thirdly, there is the journal in which the contributor is paid
  by the proprietors in a manner with which the literary editor has nothing
  to do.</p>

  <p>The third class is the safe class, as its editors know: and, as a
  usual rule, they refuse unpaid contributions of the editorial cast. It is
  said that when Canning<a name="NtA_258"
  href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> declined a cheque forwarded for an
  article in the <i>Quarterly</i>, John Murray<a name="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> sent it back with a blunt threat that
  if he did not take his money he could never be admitted again. The great
  publisher told him that if men like himself in position worked for
  nothing, all the men like himself in talent who could not afford it would
  not work for the <i>Quarterly</i>. If the above did not happen between
  Canning and Murray, it <i>must have happened</i> between some other two.
  Now journals of the second class&mdash;and of the first, if such there
  be&mdash;have a fault to which they alone are very liable, to say nothing
  of the editorial function (see the paper at the beginning, p. 11 et
  seq.), being very much cramped, a sort of gratitude towards effective
  contributors leads the journal to help their personal likes and dislikes,
  and to sympathize with them. Moreover, this sort of journal is more
  accessible than others to articles conveying personal imputation: and
  when these provoke discussion, the journal is apt to take the part of the
  assailant to whom it lent itself in the first instance.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE MECHANICS' MAGAZINE.</p>

  <p>Among the journals which went all lengths with contributors whom they
  valued, was the <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i><a name="NtA_260"
  href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> in the period 1846-56. I cannot say
  that matters have not mended in the last ten years: and I draw some <!--
  Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>[146]</span>presumption that they have mended from my
  not having heard, since 1856, of anything resembling former proceedings.
  And on actual inquiry, made since the last sentence was written, I find
  that the property has changed hands, the editor is no longer the same,
  and the management is of a different stamp. This journal is chiefly
  supported by voluntary articles: and it is the journal in which, as above
  noted, the ridiculous charge against the Astronomer Royal was made in
  1849. The following instance of attempt at revenge is so amusing that I
  select it as the instance of the defect which I intend to illustrate; for
  its puerility brings out in better relief the points which are not so
  easily seen in more adult attempts.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i>, which by its connection with
  engineering, etc., had always taken somewhat of a mathematical character,
  began, a little before 1846, to have more to do with abstract science.
  Observing this, I began to send short communications, which were always
  thankfully received, inserted, and well spoken of. Any one who looks for
  my name in that journal in 1846-49, will see nothing but the most
  respectful and even laudatory mention. In May 1849 occurred the affair at
  the Astronomical Society, and my share in forcing the withdrawal of the
  name of the alleged contributor to the journal. In February 1850 occurred
  the opportunity of payment. The <i>Companion to the Almanac</i><a
  name="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> had to be noticed, in
  which, as then usual, was an article signed with my name. I shall give
  the review of this article entire, as a sample of a certain style, as
  well as an illustration of my point. The reader will observe that my name
  is not mentioned. This would not have done; the readers of the Magazine
  would have stared to see a name of not infrequent occurrence in previous
  years all of a sudden fallen from the heaven of respect into the pit of
  contempt, like Lucifer, son of the morning. But before <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span>giving the
  review, I shall observe that Mr. Adams, in whose <i>favor</i> the attack
  on the Astronomer Royal was made, did not appreciate the favor; and of
  course did not come <span class="correction" title="text reads `forword'"
  >forward</span> to shield his champion. This gave deadly offence, as
  appear from the following passage, (February 16, 1850):</p>

  <p>"It was our intention to enter into a comparison of the contents of
  our Nautical Almanack with those of its rival, the <i>Connaissance des
  Temps</i>; but we shall defer it for the present. The Nautical Almanack
  for 1851 will contain Mr. Adams's paper 'On the Perturbation of Uranus';
  and when it comes, in due course, before the public, we are quite sure
  that that gentleman will expect that we shall again enter upon the
  subject with peculiar delight. Whilst we have a thorough loathing for
  mean, cowardly, crawlers&mdash;we have an especial pleasure in
  maintaining the claims of men who are truly grateful as well as highly
  talented: Mr. Adams, therefore, will find that he cannot be
  disappointed&mdash;and the occasion will afford us an opportunity for
  making the comparison to which we have adverted."</p>

  <p>This passage illustrates what I have said on the editorial function
  (Vol. I, p. 15). What precedes and follows has some criticism on the
  Government, the Astronomer Royal, etc., but reserved in allusion, oblique
  in sarcasm, and not fiercely uncourteous. The coarseness of the passage I
  have quoted shows editorial insertion, which is also shown by its
  blunder. The inserter is waiting for the Almanac of 1851 that he may
  review Mr. Adams's paper, which is to be contained in it. His own
  contributor, only two sentences before the insertion, had said, "The
  Nautical Almanac, we believe, is published three or four years in
  advance." In fact, the Almanac for 1851&mdash;with Mr. Adams's paper at
  the end&mdash;was published at the end of 1847 or very beginning of 1848;
  it had therefore been more than two years before the public when the
  passage quoted was written. And probably every person in the country who
  was fit to review Mr. Adams's <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page148"></a>[148]</span>paper&mdash;and most of those who were fit
  to read it&mdash;knew that it had been widely circulated, in revise, at
  the end of 1846: my copy has written on it, "2d revise, December 27,
  1846, at noon," in the handwriting of the Superintendent of the Almanac;
  and I know that there was an extensive issue of these revises, brought
  out by the Le-Verrier-and-Adams discussion. I now give the review of
  myself, (February 23, 1850):</p>

<p class="cenhead">"<i>The British Almanack and Companion.</i></p>

  <p>"The Companion to this Almanack, for some years after its first
  publication, annually contained scientific articles by Sir J. Lubbock<a
  name="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> and others of a high
  order and great interest; we have now, however, closed the publication as
  a scientific one in remembrance of what it was, and not in consequence of
  what it is. Its list of contributors on science, has grown 'small by
  degrees and beautifully less,' until it has dwindled down to one&mdash;'a
  last rose of summer left withering alone.' The one contributor has
  contributed one paper 'On Ancient and Modern Usage in Reckoning.'</p>

  <p>"The learned critic's <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>, is considered, by
  competent judges, to be an Essay on <i>Old Almanacks</i> printed a few
  years ago in this annual, and supposed to be written with the view of
  surpassing a profound memoir on the same subject by James O. Halliwell,<a
  name="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> Esq., F.R. and A.S.S.,
  but the tremendous effort which the learned writer then made to excel
  many titled competitors for honors in the antique line appears to have
  had a sad effect upon his mental powers&mdash;at any rate, his efforts
  have since yearly become duller and duller; happily, at last, we should
  suppose, 'the ancient <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>[149]</span>and modern usage in reckoning' indicates
  the lowest point to which the <i>vis inertia</i> of the learned writer's
  peculiar genius can force him.</p>

  <p>"We will give a few extracts from the article.</p>

  <p>"The learned author says, 'Those who are accustomed to settle the
  meaning of ancient phrases by self-examination will find some
  <i>strange</i> conclusions arrived at by us.' The writer never wrote a
  more correct sentence&mdash;it admits of no kind of dispute.</p>

  <p>"'Language and counting,' says the learned author, 'both came before
  the logical discussion of either. It is not allowable to argue that
  something is or was, because it ought to be or ought to have been. That
  two negatives make an affirmative, ought to be; if <i>no</i> man have
  done <i>nothing</i>, the man who has done nothing does not exist, and
  <i>every</i> man has done <i>something</i>. But in Greek, and in
  uneducated English, it is unquestionable that 'no man has done nothing'
  is only an emphatic way of saying that no man has done <i>anything</i>;
  and it would be absurd to reason that it could not have been so, because
  it should not.'&mdash;p. 5.</p>

  <p>"'But there <i>is</i> another difference between old and new times,
  yet more remarkable, for we have <i>nothing</i> of it now: whereas in
  things indivisible we count with our fathers, and should say in buying an
  acre of land, that the result has no parts, and that the purchaser, till
  he owns all the ground, owns none, the change of possession being
  instantaneous. This second difference lies in the habit of considering
  nothing, nought, zero, cipher, or whatever it may be called, to be at the
  beginning of the scale of numbers. Count four days from Monday: we should
  now say Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday; formerly, it would have
  been Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Had we asked, what at that
  rate is the first day from Monday, all would have stared at a phrase they
  had never heard. Those who were capable of extending language would have
  said, Why it must be Monday itself: the rest would have said, there can
  <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>[150]</span>be no first day from Monday, for the day
  after is Tuesday, which must be the second day: Monday, one; Tuesday,
  two,'&mdash;p. 10.</p>

  <p>"We assure our readers that the whole article is equally lucid, and
  its logic alike formal.</p>

  <p>"There are some exceedingly valuable footnotes; we give one of the
  most interesting, taken from the learned Mr. Halliwell's profound book on
  Nursery Rhymes<a name="NtA_264"
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>&mdash;a celebrated production, for
  which it is supposed the author was made F.R.S.</p>

      <p>Four's a penny,</p>
      <p>Five's a little hundred.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>'The last line refers to five score, the so-called hundred being more
  usually six score. The first line, looked at etymologically, is <i>one is
  not one</i>, and the change of thought by which <i>nine</i>, the decimal
  of <i>one</i>, aims to be associated with the decimal of <i>plurality</i>
  is curious:'&mdash;Very.</p>

  <p>"This valuable and profound essay will very probably be transferred to
  the next edition of the learned Mr. Halliwell's rare work, of kindred
  worth, entitled '<span class="sc">Rara Mathematica</span>,' it will then
  be deservedly handed down to posterity as a covering for cheap
  trunks&mdash;a most appropriate archive for such a treasure."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In December, 1846, the <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i> published a libel on
  Airy in the matter of the discovery of Neptune. In May, 1849, one *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
  was to have been brought forward for election at the Astronomical
  Society, and was opposed by me and others, on the ground that he was the
  probable author of this libel, and that he would not, perhaps could <!--
  Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>[151]</span>not,
  deny it. [N.B. I no more doubt that he was the author then I doubt that I
  am the author of this sentence.]<a name="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Accordingly, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was withdrawn, and a discussion took place, for
  which see the <i>Athenæum</i>, No. 1126, May 26, 1849, p. 544. The
  <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i> was very sore, but up to this day has never
  ventured beyond an attack on Airy, private whisperings against
  Adams&mdash;(see <i>ante</i>, p. 147),&mdash;and the above against
  myself. In due time, I doubt not my name will appear as one of the
  <i>âmes damnées</i><a name="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a>
  of the <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i>.<a name="NtA_267"
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">T.&nbsp;S. DAVIES ON EUCLID.</p>

  <p>First, as to Mr. Halliwell. The late Thomas Stephens Davies,<a
  name="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> excellent in geometry,
  and most learned in its history, was also a good hand at enmity, though
  not implacable. He and Mr. Halliwell, who had long before been very much
  one, were, at this date, very much two. I do not think T. S. Davies wrote
  this article; and I think that by giving my reasons I shall do service to
  his memory. It must have been written at the beginning of February; and
  within three days of that time T.&nbsp;S. Davies was making over to me, by his
  own free act, to be kept until claimed by the relatives, what all who
  knew even his writings knew that he considered as the most precious
  deposit he had ever had in his keeping&mdash;Horner's<a name="NtA_269"
  href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> papers. His letter announcing the
  transmission is dated February 2, 1850. This is a strong point; but there
  is another quite as strong. Euclid and <!-- Page 152 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>[152]</span>his writings were
  matters on which T.&nbsp;S. Davies knew neither fear nor favor: he could not
  have written lightly about a man who stood high with him as a judge of
  Euclid. Now in this very letter of Feb. 2, there is a sentence which I
  highly value, because, as aforesaid, it is on a point on which he would
  never have yielded anything, to which he had paid life-long attention,
  and on which he had the bias of having long stood alone. In fact,
  knowing&mdash;and what I shall quote confirms me,&mdash;that in the
  matter of Euclid his hand was against every man, I expected, when I sent
  him a copy of my 22-column article, "Eucleides" in Smith's
  <i>Dictionary</i>,<a name="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>
  to have received back a criticism, that would have blown me out of the
  water: and I thought it not unlikely that a man so well up in the subject
  might have made me feel demolished on some points. Instead of this, I got
  the following: "Although on one or two minor points I do not quite accord
  with your views, yet as a whole and without regard to any minor points, I
  think you are the first who has succeeded in a delineation of Euclid as a
  geometer." All this duly considered, it is utterly incredible that T.&nbsp;S.
  Davies should have written the review in question. And yet Mr. Halliwell
  is treated just as T.&nbsp;S. Davies would have treated him, as to tone and
  spirit. The inference in my mind is that we have here a marked instance
  of the joining of hatreds which takes place in journals supported by
  voluntary contributions of matter. Should anything ever have revived this
  article&mdash;and no one ever knows what might have been fished up from
  the forgotten mass of journals&mdash;the treatment of Mr. Halliwell would
  certainly have thrown a suspicion on T.&nbsp;S. Davies, a large and regular
  contributor to the Magazine. It is good service to his memory to point
  out what makes it incredible that he should have written so unworthy an
  article.</p>

  <p>The fault is this. There are four extracts: the first <!-- Page 153
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[153]</span>three are
  perfectly well printed. The printing of the <i>Mechanics' Magazine</i>
  was very good. I was always exceedingly satisfied with the manner in
  which my articles appeared, without my seeing proof. Most likely these
  extracts were printed from my printed paper; if not the extractor was a
  good copier. I know this by a test which has often served me. I use the
  subjunctive&mdash;"if no man <i>have</i> done nothing," an ordinary
  transcriber, narrating a quotation almost always lets his own habit write
  <i>has</i>. The fourth extract has three alterations, all tending to make
  me ridiculous. <i>None</i> is altered, in two places, into <i>nine</i>,
  <i>denial</i> into <i>decimal</i>, and <i>comes</i> into <i>aims</i>; so
  that "none, the denial of one, comes to be associated with the denial of
  plurality," reads as "nine, the decimal of one, aims to be associated
  with the decimal of plurality." This is intentional; had it been a
  compositor's reading of bad handwriting, these would not have been the
  only mistakes; to say nothing of the corrector of the press. And both the
  compositor and reader would have guessed, from the first line being
  translated into "one is not one," that it must have been "one's none,"
  not "one's nine." But it was not intended that the gem should be
  recovered from the unfathomed cave, and set in a Budget of Paradoxes.</p>

  <p>We have had plenty of slander-paradox. I now give a halfpennyworth of
  bread to all this sack, an instance of the paradox of benevolence, in
  which an individual runs counter to all the ideas of his time, and sees
  his way into the next century. At Amiens, at the end of the last century,
  an institution was endowed by a M. de Morgan, to whom I hope I am of kin,
  but I cannot trace it; the name is common at Amiens. It was the first of
  the kind I ever heard of. It is a Salle d'Asyle for children, who are
  taught and washed and taken care of during the hours in which their
  parents must be at work. The founder was a large wholesale grocer and
  colonial importer, who was made a Baron by Napoleon I for his commercial
  success and his charities. <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<p class="cenhead">JAS. SMITH AGAIN.</p>

  <p>1862. Mr. Smith replies to me, still signing himself Nauticus: I give
  an extract:</p>

  <p>"By hypothesis [what, again!] let 14° 24' be the chord of an arc of
  15° [but I wont, says 14° 24'], and consequently equal to a side of a
  regular polygon of 24 sides inscribed in the circle. Then 4 times 14° 24'
  = 57° 36' = the radius of the circle ..."</p>

  <p>That is, four times the chord of an arc is the chord of four times the
  arc: and the sum of four sides of a certain pentagon is equal to the
  fifth. This is the capital of the column, the crown of the arch, the apex
  of the pyramid, the watershed of the elevation. Oh! J.&nbsp;S.! J.&nbsp;S.! groans
  Geometry&mdash;<i>Summum J.&nbsp;S. summa injuria</i>!<a name="NtA_271"

  name="NtA_272" href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> as already mentioned,
  had his own way of denying that a straight line is always the shortest
  distance between two points. A parallel might be instituted, but not in
  half a column. And J.&nbsp;S. the <i>second</i> has been so tightly handled
  that he may now be dismissed, with an inscription for his circular
  shield, obtained by changing <i>Lexica contexat</i> into <i>Circus
  quadrandus</i> in an epigram of J.&nbsp;S. the <i>first</i>:</p>

  <p>I had written as far as <i>damnatum</i> when in came the letter of
  Nauticus as a printed slip, with a request that I would consider the slip
  as a 'revised copy.' Not a word of alteration in the part I have quoted!
  And in the evening came a letter desiring that I would alter a gross
  error; but not the one above: this is revising without revision! If there
  were cyclometers enough of this stamp, they would, as cultivation
  progresses&mdash;and really, with John Stuart Mill in for Westminster, it
  seems on the move, even though, as I learn while correcting the proof,
  Gladstone be out from Oxford; for Oxford is no worse than in 1829, while
  Westminster is far above what she ever has been: election time excuses
  even such a parenthesis as this&mdash;be engaged to amuse those who can
  afford it with paralogism at their meals, after the manner of the other
  jokers who wore the caps and bells. The rich would then order their
  dinners with <i>panem et Circenses</i>,&mdash;up with the victuals and
  the circle-games&mdash;as the poor did in the days of old.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith is determined that half a column shall not do. Not a day
  without something from him: letter, printed proof, pamphlet. In what is
  the last at this moment of writing he tells me that part of the title of
  a work of his will be "Professor De Morgan in the pillory without hope of
  escape." And where will he be himself? This I detected by an effort of
  reasoning which I never could have made except by following in his steps.
  In all matters connected with <span class="grk">&pi;</span> the letters
  <i>l</i> and <i>g</i> are closely related: this appears in the well-known
  formula for the time of oscillation <span class="grk">&pi;</span>
  &radic;(<i>l</i> : <i>g</i>). Hence <i>g</i> may be written for <i>l</i>,
  but only once: do it twice, and you require the time to be <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> &radic;(<i>l</i><sup>2</sup> :
  <i>g</i><sup>2</sup>). This may be reinforced by observing that if as a
  datum, or if you dislike that word, by hypothesis, the first <i>l</i> be
  a <i>g</i>, it is absurd that it should be an <i>l</i>. Write <i>g</i>
  for the first <i>l</i>, and we have <i>un fait accompli</i>. I shall be
  in pillory; and overhead, in a cloud, will sit Mr. James Smith on one
  stick laid across two others, under a nimbus of 3&#x215B; diameters to

  class="grk">&pi;</span>-glory. Oh for a drawing of this scene! Mr. De
  Morgan presents his compliments to Mr. James Smith, and requests the
  honor of an exchange of photographs.</p>

  <p><i>July 26.</i>&mdash;Another printed letter.&mdash;Mr. James Smith
  begs for a distinct answer to the following plain question: "Have I not
  in this communication brought under your notice <i>truths</i> that were
  never before dreamed of in your geometrical and mathematical philosophy?"
  To which, he having taken the precaution to print the word <i>truths</i>
  in italics, I can conscientiously answer, Yes, you have. And now I shall
  take no more notice of these <i>truths</i>, until I receive something
  which surpasses all that has yet been done.</p>

  <p>Dr. Pratt not only upsets Newton, but cuts away the very ground he
  stands on: for he destroys the first law of motion, and will not have the
  natural tendency of matter in motion to be rectilinear. This, as we have
  seen, was John Walsh's<a name="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> notion. In a more recent work "On
  Orbital Motion," London, 1863, 8vo., Dr. Pratt insists on another of
  Walsh's notions, namely, that the precession of the equinoxes is caused
  by the motion of the solar system round a distant central sun. In this
  last work the author refers to a few notes, which completely destroy the
  theory of gravitation in terms "perfectly intelligible as well to the
  unlearned as to the learned": to me they are quite unintelligible, which
  rather tends to confirm a notion I have long had, that I am neither one
  thing nor the other. There is an ambiguity of phrase which delights a
  writer on logic, always on the look-out for specimens of <i>homonymia</i>
  or <i>æquivocatio</i>. The author, as a physician, is accustomed to
  "appeal from mere formulæ": accordingly, he sets at nought the whole of
  the mathematics, which he does not understand. This equivocation between
  the formula of the physician and that of the mathematician is as good,
  though not so perceptible to the world at large, as that made by Mr.
  Briggs's friend in <i>Punch's</i> picture, which I cut out to paste into
  my Logic. Mr. Briggs wrote for a couple of <i>bruisers</i>, meaning to
  prepare oats for his horses: his friend sent him the Whitechapel Chicken
  and the Bayswater Slasher, with the gloves, all ready.</p>

  <p>This is much about <i>Thorn</i>, and its connected words, Thor, Thoth,
  Theta, etc. It is a very mysterious vagary. The author of it is the
  person whom I have described elsewhere as having for his device the round
  man in the three-cornered hole, the writer of the little heap of
  satirical anonymous letters about the Beast and 666. By accident I
  discovered the writer: so that if there be any more thorns to crackle
  under the pot, they need not be anonymous.</p>

  <p>Nor will they be anonymous. Since I wrote the above, I have received
  <i>onymous</i> letters, as <i>ominous</i> as the rest. The writer,
  William Thorn, M.D., is obliged to reveal <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[159]</span>himself, since it is
  his object to prove that he himself is one 666. By using W for double Vau
  (or 12) he cooks the number out of his own name. But he says it is the
  number not of a beast but of a man, and adds, "Thereby hangs a tale!"
  which sounds like contradiction. He informs me that he will talk the
  matter over with me: but I shall certainly have nothing to say to a
  gentleman of his number; it is best to keep on the safe side.</p>

  <p>In one letter I am informed that not a line should I have had, but for
  my "sneer at 666," which, therefore, I am well pleased to have given. I
  am also told that my name means the "'garden of death,' that place in
  which the tree of knowledge was plucked, and so you are like your name
  'dead' to the fact that you are an Israelite, like those in Ezekiel 37
  ch." Some hints are given that I shall not fare well in the next world,
  which any one who reads the chapter in Ezekiel will see is quite against
  his comparison. The reader must not imagine that my prognosticator means
  <i>Morgan</i> to be a corruption of <i>Mortjardin</i>; he proves his
  point by Hebrew: but any philologist would tell him the true derivation
  of the name, and how <i>Glamorgan</i> came to get it. It will be of much
  comfort to those young men who have not got through to know that the tree
  of knowledge itself was once in the same case. And so good bye to 666 for
  the present, and the assumption that the enigma is to be solved by the
  united numeral forces of the letters of a word.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that, as soon as my Budget commenced, two
  guardian spirits started up, fellow men as to the flesh, both totally
  unknown to me: they have stuck to me from first to last. James Smith,
  Esq., finally Nauticus, watches over my character in this world, and
  would fain preserve me from ignorance, folly, and dishonesty, by
  inclosing me in a magic circle of 3&#x215B; diameters in circumference.
  The round man in the three-cornered hole, finally William Thorn, M.D.,
  takes charge of my future destiny, <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>[160]</span>and tries to bring me
  to the truth by unfolding a score of meanings&mdash;all right&mdash;of
  666. He hints that I, and my wife, are servants of Satan: at least he
  desires us both to remember that we cannot serve God and Satan; and he
  can hardly mean that we are serving the first, and that he would have us
  serve the second. As becomes an interpreter of the Apocalypse, he uses
  seven different seals; but not more than one to one letter. If his seals
  be all signet-rings, he must be what Aristophanes calls a
  sphragidonychargocometical fellow. But&mdash;and many thanks to him for
  the same&mdash;though an M.D., he has not sent me a single vial. And so
  much for my tree of secular knowledge and my tree of spiritual life: I
  dismiss them with thanks from myself and thanks from my reader. The dual
  of the Pythagorean system was Isis and Diana; of the Jewish law, Moses
  and Aaron; and of the City of London, Gog and Magog; of the Paradoxiad,
  James Smith, Esq., and William Thorn, M.D.</p>

  <p><i>September, 1866.</i> Mr. James Biden<a name="NtA_280"
  href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> has favored me with some of his
  publications. He is a rival of Dr. Thorn; a prophet by name-right and
  crest-right. He is of royal descent through the De Biduns. He is the
  <i>watchman</i> of Ezekiel: God has told him so. He is the author of
  <i>The True Church</i>, a phrase which seems to have a book-meaning and a
  mission-meaning. He shall speak for himself:</p>

  <p>"A crest of the Bidens has significance. It is a lion rampant between
  wings&mdash;wings in Scripture denote the flight of time. Thus the beasts
  or living creatures of the Revelations have each six wings, intimating a
  condition of mankind up to and towards the close of six thousand years of
  Bible teaching. The two wings of the crest would thus intimate power
  towards the expiration of 2000 years, as time is marked in the history of
  Great Britain.</p>

<p><!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[161]</span></p>

  <p>"In a recent publication, <i>The Pestilence, Why Inflicted</i>, are
  given many reasons why the writer thinks himself to be the appointed
  watchman foretold by Ezekiel, chapters iii. and xxxiii. Among the reasons
  are many prophecies fulfilled in him. Of these it is now needful to note
  two as bearing especially on the subject of the reign of Darius.</p>

  <p>"1.&mdash;In Daniel it is said, 'Darius the Median took the kingdom,
  being about threescore and two years old.'&mdash;Daniel v. 31.</p>

  <p>"When 'Belshazzar' the king of the Chaldeans is found wanting, Darius
  takes the kingdom. It is not given him by the popular voice; he asserts
  his right, and this is not denied. He takes it when about sixty-two years
  of age. The language of Daniel is prophetic, and Darius has in another an
  antitype. The writer was born July 18th, 1803; and the claim was asserted
  at the close of 1865, when he was about sixty-two years of age.</p>

  <p>"The claims which have been asserted demand a settled faith, and which
  could only be reached through a long course of divine teaching."</p>

  <p>When I was a little boy at school, one of my school-fellows took it
  into his head to set up a lottery of marbles: the thing took, and he made
  a stony profit. Soon, one after another, every boy had his lottery, and
  it was, "I won't put into yours unless you put into mine." This knocked
  up the scheme. It will be the same with the prophets. Dr. Thorn, Mr.
  Biden, Mrs. Cottle,<a name="NtA_281" href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a>
  etc. will grow imitators, until we are all pointed out in the Bible: but
  A will not admit B's claim unless B admits his. For myself, as elsewhere
  shown, I am the first Beast in the Revelations.</p>

  <p>Every contraband prophet gets a few followers: it is a great point to
  make these sequacious people into Buridan's asses, which they will become
  when prophets are so numerous that there is no choosing.</p>

  <p>There are few men of our day whom I admire more than the late Sir G.
  Lewis: he was honest, earnest, sagacious, learned, and industrious. He
  probably sacrificed his life to his conjunction of literature and
  politics: and he stood high as a minister of state in addition to his
  character as a man of letters. The work above named is of great value,
  and will be read for its intrinsic merit, consulted for its crowd of
  valuable references, quoted for its aid to one side of many a discussion,
  and opposed for its force against the other. Its author was also a wit
  and a satirist. I know of three classical satires of our day which are
  inimitable imitations: Mr. Malden's<a name="NtA_283"

  class="scac">HEYDIDDLEDIDDLETHECATANDTHEFIDDLE</span> etc. is treated as
  an Oscan inscription, and rendered into Latin by approved methods. As few
  readers have seen it, I give the result:</p>

  <p>How then comes the history of astronomy among the paradoxes? Simply
  because the author, so admirably when writing about what he knew, did not
  know what he did not know, and blundered like a circle-squarer. And why
  should the faults of so good a writer be recorded in such a list as the
  present? For three reasons: First, and foremost, because if the exposure
  be not made by some one, the errors will gradually ooze out, and the work
  will get the character of inaccurate. Nothing hurts a book of which few
  can fathom the depths so much as a plain blunder or two on the surface.
  Secondly, because the reviews either passed over these errors or treated
  them too gently, rather implying their existence than exposing them.
  Thirdly, because they strongly illustrate the melancholy truth, that no
  one knows enough to write about what he does not know. The distinctness
  of the errors is a merit; it proceeds from the clear-headedness of the
  author. The suppression in the journals may be due partly to admiration
  of the talent and energy which lived two difficult lives at once, partly
  to respect for high position in public affairs, partly to some of the
  critics being themselves men of learning only, unable to detect the
  errors. But we know that action and reaction are equal and contrary. If
  our generation take no notice of defects, and allow them to go down
  undetected among merits, the next generation will discover them, will
  perhaps believe us incapable of detecting them, at least will pronounce
  our judgment good for nothing, and will form an <!-- Page 164 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>[164]</span>opinion in which the
  merits will be underrated: so it has been, is, and will be. The best
  thing that can be done for the memory of the author is to remove the
  unsound part that the remainder may thrive. The errors do not affect the
  work; they occur in passages which might very well have been omitted: and
  I consider that, in making them conspicuous, I am but cutting away a
  deleterious fungus from a noble tree.</p>

  <p>(P. 154). The periodic times of the five planets were stated by
  Eudoxus,<a name="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> as we learn
  from Simplicius;<a name="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> the
  following is his statement, to which the true times are subjoined, for
  the sake of comparison:</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><span class="scac">STATEMENT OF EUDOXUS</span></td><td align="center"><span class="scac">TRUE TIME</span></td></tr>

</table>

  <p>Upon this determination two remarks may be made. First, the error with
  respect to Mercury and Venus is considerable; with respect to Mercury, it
  is, in round numbers, 365 instead of 88 days, more than four times too
  much. Aristotle remarks that Eudoxus distinguishes Mercury and Venus from
  the other three planets by giving them one sphere each, with the poles in
  common. The proximity of Mercury to the sun would render its course
  difficult to observe and to measure, but the cause of the large error
  with respect to Venus (130 days) is not apparent.</p>

<p><!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>[165]</span></p>

  <p>Sir G. Lewis takes Eudoxus as making the planets move round the sun;
  he has accordingly compared the <i>geocentric</i> periods of Eudoxus with
  our <i>heliocentric</i> periods. What greater blunder can be made by a
  writer on ancient astronomy than giving Eudoxus the Copernican system? If
  Mercury were a black spot in the middle of the sun it would of course
  move round the earth in a year, or appear to do so: let it swing a little
  on one side and the other of the sun, and the average period is still a
  year, with slight departures both ways. The same for Venus, with larger
  departures. Say that a person not much accustomed to the distinction
  might for once write down the mistake; how are we to explain its
  remaining in the mind in a permanent form, and being made a ground for
  such speculation as that of the difficulty of observing Mercury leading
  to a period four times what it ought to be, corrected in proof and
  published by an industrious and thoughtful person? Only in one way: the
  writer was quite out of his depth. This one case is conclusive; be it
  said with all respect for the real staple of the work and of the author.
  He knew well the difference of the systems, but not the effect of the
  difference: he is another instance of what I have had to illustrate by
  help of a very different person, that it is difficult to reason well upon
  matter which is not familiar.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>(P. 254). Copernicus, in fact, supposed the axis of the earth to be
  always turned towards the Sun.<sup>(169)</sup> [(169). See Delambre,
  <i>Hist. Astr. Mod.</i>, Vol. I, p. 96]. It was reserved to Kepler to
  propound the hypothesis of the constant parallelism of the earth's axis
  to itself.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>If there be one thing more prominent than another in the work of
  Copernicus himself, in the popular explanations of it, and in the page of
  Delambre<a name="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> cited, it
  is that the <i>parallelism of the earth's axis</i> is a glaring part of
  the <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page166"></a>[166]</span>theory of Copernicus. What Kepler<a
  name="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> did was to throw away,
  as unnecessary, the method by which Copernicus, <i>per fas et
  nefas</i>,<a name="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> secured
  it. Copernicus, thinking of the earth's orbital revolution as those would
  think who were accustomed to the <i>solid orbs</i>&mdash;and much as the
  stoppers of the moon's rotation do now: why do they not strengthen
  themselves with Copernicus?&mdash;thought that the earth's axis would
  always incline the same end towards the sun, unless measures were taken
  to prevent it. He <i>did</i> take measures: he invented a
  <i>compensating</i> conical motion of the axis to preserve the
  parallelism; and, which is one of the most remarkable points of his
  system, he obtained the precession of the equinoxes by giving the
  necessary trifle more than compensation. What stares us in the face at
  the beginning of the paragraph to which the author refers?</p>

  <p>"C'est donc pour arriver à ce parallelisme, ou pour le conserver, que
  Copernic a cru devoir recourir à ce mouvement égal et opposé qui détruit
  l'effet qu'il attribue si gratuitement au premier, de déranger le
  parallelisme."<a name="NtA_291" href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Parallelism at any price, is the motto of Copernicus: you need not pay
  so dear, is the remark of Kepler.</p>

  <p>The opinions given by Sir G. Lewis about the effects of modern
  astronomy, which he does not understand and singularly undervalues, will
  now be seen to be of no authority. He fancies that&mdash;to give an
  instance&mdash;for the determination of a ship's place, the invention of
  chronometers has been far more important than any improvement in
  astronomical theory (p. 254). Not to speak of latitude,&mdash;though the
  omission is not without importance,&mdash;he ought to have known that
  longitude is found by the difference between what o'clock it is at
  Greenwich and at the ship's place, at <!-- Page 167 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>[167]</span>one absolute moment of
  time. Now if a chronometer were quite perfect&mdash;which no chronometer
  is, be it said&mdash;and would truly tell Greenwich mean time all over
  the world, it ought to have been clear that just as good a watch is
  wanted for the time at <i>the place of observation</i>, before the
  longitude of that place with respect to Greenwich can be found. There is
  no such watch, except the starry heaven itself: and that watch can only
  be read by astronomical observation, aided by the best knowledge of the
  heavenly motions.</p>

  <p>I think I have done Sir G. Lewis's very excellent book more good than
  all the reviewers put together.</p>

  <p>I will give an old instance in which literature got into confusion
  about astronomy. Theophrastus,<a name="NtA_292"
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> who is either the culprit or his
  historian, attributes to Meton,<a name="NtA_293"
  href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> the contriver of the lunar calendar
  of nineteen years, which lasts to this day, that his solstices were
  determined for him by a certain Phaeinus of Elis on Mount Lycabettus.
  Nobody else mentions this astronomer: though it is pretty certain that
  Meton himself made more than one appointment with him for the purpose of
  observing solstices; and we may be sure that if either were behind his
  time, it was Meton. For <i>Phaeinus Helius</i> is the shining sun
  himself; and in the astronomical poet Aratus<a name="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> we read about the nineteen years of
  the shining sun:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  not observe that Phaeinus is a very common adjective of Aratus, and that,
  if his conjecture were right, this Phaeinus would be the only
  non-mythical man in the poems of Aratus.</p>

  <p>[When I read Sir George Lewis's book, the points which I have
  criticized struck me as not to be wondered at, but I did not remember why
  at the time. A Chancellor of the Exchequer and a writer on ancient
  astronomy are birds of such different trees that the second did not
  recall the first. In 1855 I was one of a deputation of about twenty
  persons who waited on Sir G. Lewis, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, on
  the subject of a decimal coinage. The deputation was one of much force:
  Mr. Airy, with myself and others, represented mathematics; William
  Brown,<a name="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> whose
  dealings with the United States were reckoned by yearly millions, counted
  duodecimally in England and decimally in America, was the best, but not
  the only, representative of commerce. There were bullionists,
  accountants, retailers, etc. Sir G.&nbsp;L. walked into the room, took his
  seat, and without waiting one moment, began to read the deputation a
  smart lecture on the evils of a decimal coinage; it would require
  alteration of all the tables, it would impede calculation, etc. etc. Of
  those arguments against it which weighed with many of better knowledge
  than his, he obviously knew nothing. The members of the deputation began
  to make their statements, and met with curious denials. He interrupted me
  with "Surely there is no doubt that the calculations of our books of
  arithmetic are easier <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>[169]</span>than those in the French books." He was
  not aware that the <i>universally admitted</i> superiority of decimal
  <i>calculation</i> made many of those who prefer our system for the
  market and the counter cast a longing and lingering look towards

  queer puzzled look, which seemed to say, "I may be out of my depth here!"
  His manner changed, and he listened. I saw both the slap-dash mode in
  which he dealt with subjects on which he had not thought, and the
  temperament which admitted suspicion when the means of knowledge came in
  his way. Having seen his two phases, I wonder neither at his more than

<p class="cenhead">DECIMAL COINAGE.</p>

  <p>Among the paradoxers are the political paradoxers who care not how far
  they go in debate, their only object being to carry the House with them
  for the current evening. What I have said of editors I repeat of them.
  The preservation of a very marked instance, the association of political
  recklessness with cyclometrical and Apocalyptic absurdity, may have a
  tendency to warn, not indeed any hardened public-man and sinner, but some
  young minds which have yearnings towards politics, and are in formation
  of habits.</p>

  <p>In the debate on decimal coinage of July 12, 1855, Mr. Lowe,<a
  name="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> then member for
  Kidderminster, an effective speaker and a smart man, exhibited himself in
  a speech on which I wrote a comment for the Decimal Association. I have
  seldom seen a more wretched attempt to distort the points of a public
  question than the whole of this speech. Looking at the intelligence shown
  by the speaker on other occasions, <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[170]</span>it is clear that if
  charity, instead of believing all things, believed only all things but
  one, he might tremble for his political character; for the honesty of his
  intention on this occasion might be the incredible exception. I give a
  few paragraphs with comments:</p>

  <p>"In commenting on the humorous, but still argumentative speech of Mr.
  Lowe, the member for Kidderminster, we may observe, in general, that it
  consists of points which have been several times set forth, and several
  times answered. Mr. Lowe has seen these answers, but does not allude to
  them, far less attempt to meet them. There are, no doubt, individuals,
  who show in their public speaking the outward and visible signs of a
  greater degree of acuteness than they can summon to guide their private
  thinking. If Mr. Lowe be not one of these, if the power of his mind in
  the closet be at all comparable to the power of his tongue in the House,
  it may be suspected that his reserve with respect to what has been put
  forward by the very parties against whom he was contending, arises from
  one or both of two things&mdash;a high opinion of the arguments which he
  ignored&mdash;a low opinion of the generality of the persons whom he
  addressed. [Both, I doubt not].</p>

      <p>In the name of common sense, how can it be objected to a system
      that people do not use it before it is introduced? Let the decimal
      system be completed, and calculation shall be made in florins; that
      is, florins shall take their proper place. If florins were introduced

      generally paid half-a-crown." (Hear, hear, and laughter.)</p>

  And as to Jonathan, who is but John lengthened out a little, he would see

  henceforth be called the Kidderminster difference. The House, not
  unmoved&mdash;for it laughed&mdash;with sly humor decided that the
  introduction of the florin had been "eminently successful and
  satisfactory."</p>

  <p>The truth is that Mr. Lowe here attacks nothing except the coexistence
  of the florin and half-crown. We are endeavoring to abolish the
  half-crown. Let Mr. Lowe join us; and he will, if we succeed, be relieved
  from the pressure on his pocket which must arise from having the turn of
  the market always against him.</p>

  <p>Now, if Mr. Lowe insists on it that our integer is the pound, he is
  bound to admit that the present integer is the pound, of which a
  shilling, etc., are fractions. The next time he has a chop and a pint of
  stout in the city, the waiter should say&mdash;"A pound, sir, to you,"
  and should add, "Please to remember the waiter in integers." Mr. Lowe
  fancies that when he pays one and sixpence, he pays in integers, and so
  he does, if his integer be a penny or a sixpence. Let him bring his mind
  to contemplate a mil as the integer, the lowest integer, and the seven
  cents five mils which he would pay under the new system would be payment
  in integers also. But, as it happens with some others, he looks <i>up</i>
  the present system, with Cocker,<a name="NtA_299"

  proposed system. The word <i>decimal</i> is obstinately associated with
  <i>fractions</i>, for which there is no need. Hence it becomes so much of
  a bugbear, that, to parody the lines of Pope, which probably suggested
  one of Mr. Lowe's phrases&mdash;</p>

      <p>Let the members be assured that nine half-pence will be, for every

      maintain that during the long period he sat in the House, he never
      knew more than three men in it, at one time, who had a tolerable
      notion of fractions. [I heard him give the names of three at the time
      when he spoke: they were Warburton,<a name="NtA_302"
      href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> Pollock,<a name="NtA_303"
      href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> and Hume.<a name="NtA_304"
      href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> He himself was then out of
      Parliament.] Joseph Hume affirmed that he had never met with more
      than ten members who were arithmeticians. But both these gentlemen
      had a high standard. Mr. Lowe has given a much more damaging opinion.
      He evidently means that the general run of members could not do his
      question. It is done as follows: Since farthings gain on mils, at the
      rate of a whole mil in 24 farthings (24 farthings being 25 mils), it
      is clear that 18 farthings being three-quarters of 24 farthings, will
      gain three-quarters of a mil; that is, 18 farthings are eighteen <!--
      Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page175"></a>[175]</span>mils and three-quarters of a mil. Any
      number of farthings is as many mils and as many twenty-fourths of a
      mil. To a certain extent, we feel able to protest against the manner
      in which Kidderminster has treated the other constituencies. We do
      not hold it impossible to give the Members of the House in general a
      sufficient knowledge of the meaning and consequences of the
      <i>decimal</i> succession of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.;
      and we believe that there are in the House itself competent men, in
      number enough to teach all the rest. All that is wanted is the power
      of starting from the known to arrive at the unknown. Now there is one
      kind of decimals with which every member is acquainted&mdash;the
      <i>Chiltern Hundreds</i>. If public opinion would enable the
      competent minority to start from this in their teaching, not as a
      basis, but as an alternative, in three weeks the fundamentals would
      be acquired, and members in general would be as fit to turn 4½d. into
      mils, as any boys on the lower forms of a commercial school.</p>
      <p>For a long period of years, allusion to the general ignorance of
      arithmetic, has been a standing mode of argument, and has always been
      well received: whenever one member describes others as
      <i>knownothings</i>, those others cry <i>Hear</i> to the country in a
      transport of delight. In the meanwhile the country is gradually
      arriving at the conclusion that a true joke is no joke.</p>

  <p>Secondly, he assumes that the penny, such as it now is, will remain,
  as a coin of estimation, after it has ceased to be a coin of exchange;
  and that the mass of the people will continue to think of prices in old
  pence, and to calculate them in new ones, or else in new mils. No answer
  is required to this, beyond the mere statement of the nature of the
  assumption and denial.</p>

<p><!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>[180]</span></p>

  <p>Thirdly, he attributes to the uneducated community a want of
  perception and of operative power which really does not belong to them.
  The evidence offered to the Committee of the House shows that no fear is
  entertained on this point by those who come most in contact with farthing
  purchasers. And this would seem to be a rule,&mdash;that is, fear of the
  intelligence of the lower orders in the minds of those who are not in
  daily communication with them, no fear at all in the minds of those who
  are.</p>

  <p>A remarkable instance of this distinction happened five-and-twenty
  years ago. The Admiralty requested the Astronomical Society to report on
  the alterations which should be made in the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>, the
  seaman's guide-book over the ocean. The greatest alteration proposed was
  the description of celestial phenomena in <i>mean</i> (or clock time),
  instead of <i>apparent</i> (or sundial) time, till then always employed.
  This change would require that in a great many operations the seaman
  should let alone what he formerly altered by addition or subtraction, and
  alter by addition or subtraction what he formerly let alone; provided
  always that what he formerly altered by addition he should, when he
  altered at all, alter by subtraction, and <i>vice versa</i>. This was a
  tolerably difficult change for uneducated skippers, working by rules they
  had only learned by rote. The Astronomical Society appointed a Committee
  of forty, of whom nine were naval officers or merchant seamen [I was on
  this Committee]. Some men of science were much afraid of the change. They
  could not trust an ignorant skipper or mate to make those alterations in
  their routine, on the correctness of which the ship might depend. Had the
  Committee consisted of men of science only, the change might never have
  been ventured on. But the naval men laughed, and said there was nothing
  to fear; and on their authority the alteration was made. The upshot was,
  that, after the new almanacs appeared, not a word of complaint was ever
  heard on the matter. Had the House of Commons had to <!-- Page 181
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[181]</span>decide this
  question, with Mr. Lowe to quote the description given by Basil Hall<a
  name="NtA_306" href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> (who, by the way, was
  one of the Committee) of an observation on which the safety of the ship
  depended, worked out by the light of a lantern in a gale of wind off a
  lee shore, this simple and useful change might at this moment have been
  in the hands of its tenth Government Commission.</p>

  <p>A paper read&mdash;but, according to the report, not

  "independent quantities or unconnected events, which is the theory of

  <p>On the principles and practice of just Intonation, with a view to the
  abolition of temperament.... By General Perronet Thompson.<a
  name="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> Sixth Edition. London,
  1862, 8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here is General Thompson again, with another paradox: but always
  master of the subject, always well up in what his predecessors have done,
  and always aiming at a useful end. He desires to abolish temperament by
  additional keys, and has constructed an enharmonic organ with forty
  sounds in the octave. If this can be introduced, I, for one, shall
  delight to hear it: but there are very great difficulties in the way,
  greater than stood even in the way of the repeal of the bread-tax.</p>

  <p>In a paper on the beats of organ-pipes and on temperament published
  some years ago, I said that equal temperament appeared to me insipid, and
  not so agreeable as the effect of the instrument when in progress towards
  being what is called out of tune, before it becomes offensively wrong.
  There is throughout that period unequal temperament, determined by
  accident. General Thompson, taking me one way, says I have launched a
  declaration which is likely to make an epoch in musical practice; a
  public musical critic, taking me another way, quizzes me for preferring
  music <i>out of tune</i>. I do not think I deserve either one remark or
  the other. My opponent critic, I suspect, takes <i>equally tempered</i>
  and <i>in tune</i> to be phrases of one meaning. But by equal temperament
  is meant equal distribution among all the keys of the error which an
  instrument <i>must</i> have, which, with twelve sounds only in the
  octave, professes to be fit for all the keys. I am reminded of the equal
  temperament which was once applied to the postmen's jackets. The coats
  were all made for the average man: the <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>[186]</span>consequence was that
  all the tall men had their tails too short; all the short men had them
  too long. Some one innocently asked why the tall men did not change coats
  with the short ones.</p>

<p class="cenhead">HORNER'S METHOD.</p>

  <p>I think it may be admited that the indisposition to look at and
  encourage improvements of calculation which once <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>[188]</span>marked the Royal
  Society is no longer in existence. But not without severe lessons. They
  had the luck to accept Horner's<a name="NtA_325"
  href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> now celebrated paper, containing the
  method which is far on the way to become universal: but they refused the
  paper in which Horner developed his views of this and other subjects: it
  was printed by T.&nbsp;S. Davies<a name="NtA_326"
  href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> after Horner's death. I make myself
  responsible for the statement that the Society could not reject this
  paper, yet felt unwilling to print it, and suggested that it should be
  withdrawn; which was done.</p>

  <p>But the severest lesson was the loss of <i>Barrett's Method</i>,<a
  name="NtA_327" href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> now the universal
  instrument of the actuary in his highest calculations. It was presented
  to the Royal Society, and refused admission into the <i>Transactions</i>:
  Francis Baily<a name="NtA_328" href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a>
  printed it. The Society is now better informed: "<i>live and learn</i>,"
  meaning "<i>must live, so better learn</i>," ought to be the especial
  motto of a corporation, and is generally acted on, more or less.</p>

  <p>Horner's method begins to be introduced at Cambridge: it was published
  in 1820. I remember that when I first went to Cambridge (in 1823) I heard
  my tutor say, in conversation, there is no doubt that the true method of
  solving equations is the one which was published a few years ago in the
  <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>. I wondered it was not taught, but
  presumed that it belonged to the higher mathematics. This Horner himself
  had in his head: and in a sense it is true; for all lower branches belong
  to the higher: but he would have stared to have been told that he,
  Horner, <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>[189]</span>was without a European predecessor, and in
  the distinctive part of his discovery was heir-at-law to the nameless
  Brahmin&mdash;Tartar&mdash;Antenoachian&mdash;what you please&mdash;who
  concocted the extraction of the square root.</p>

  <p>It was somewhat more than twenty years after I had thus heard a
  Cambridge tutor show sense of the true place of Horner's method, that a
  pupil of mine who had passed on to Cambridge was desired by his college
  tutor to solve a certain cubic equation&mdash;one of an integer root of
  two figures. In a minute the work and answer were presented, by Horner's
  method. "How!" said the tutor, "this can't be, you know." "There is the
  answer, Sir!" said my pupil, greatly amused, for my pupils learnt, not
  only Horner's method, but the estimation it held at Cambridge. "Yes!"
  said the tutor, "there is the answer certainly; but it <i>stands to
  reason</i> that a cubic equation cannot be solved in this space." He then
  sat down, went through a process about ten times as long, and then said
  with triumph: "There! that is the way to solve a cubic equation!"</p>

  <p>I think the tutor in this case was never matched, except by the
  country organist. A master of the instrument went into the organ-loft
  during service, and asked the organist to let him <i>play the
  congregation out</i>; consent was given. The stranger, when the time
  came, began a voluntary which made the people open their ears, and wonder
  who had got into the loft: they kept their places to enjoy the treat.
  When the organist saw this, he pushed the interloper off the stool, with
  "You'll never play 'em out this side Christmas." He then began his own
  drone, and the congregation began to move quietly away. "There," said he,
  "that's the way to play 'em out!"</p>

  <p>I have not scrupled to bear hard on my own university, on the Royal
  Society, and on other respectable existences: being very much the friend
  of all. I will now clear the Royal Society from a very small and obscure
  slander, simply because I know how. This dissertation began with <!--
  Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>[190]</span>the
  work of Mr. Oliver Byrne, the dual arithmetician, etc. This writer
  published, in 1849, a method of calculating logarithms.<a name="NtA_329"
  href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> First, a long list of instances in
  which, as he alleges, foreign discoverers have been pillaged by
  Englishmen, or turned into Englishmen: for example, O'Neill,<a
  name="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> so called by Mr.
  Byrne, the rectifier of the semi-cubical parabola claimed by the Saxons
  under the name of <i>Neal</i>: the grandfather of this mathematician was
  conspicuous enough as <i>Neal</i>; he was archbishop of York. This list,
  says the writer, might be continued without end; but he has mercy, and
  finishes with his own case, as follows:&mdash;"About twenty years ago, I
  discovered this method of directly calculating logarithms. I could
  generally find the logarithm of any number in a minute or two without the
  use of books or tables. The importance of the discovery subjected me to
  all sorts of prying. Some asserted that I committed a table of logarithms
  to memory; others attributed it to a peculiar mental property; and when
  Societies and individuals failed to extract my secret, they never failed
  to traduce the inventor and the invention. Among the learned Societies,
  the Royal Society of London played a very base part. When I have more
  space and time at my disposal, I will revert to this subject again."</p>

  <p>Such a trumpery story as this remains unnoticed at the time; but when
  all are gone, a stray copy from a stall falls into hands which, not
  knowing what to make of it, make history of it. It is a very curious
  distortion. The reader may take it on my authority, that the Royal
  Society played no part, good or bad, nor had the option of playing a
  part. <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>All this is quite possible, and the probabilities for and against are
  quite out of reach. Perhaps also all the worlds, both above and below us,
  are fac-similes of our own. If so, away goes free will for good and all;
  unless, indeed, we underpin our system with the hypothesis that all the
  fac-simile bodies of different sizes are actuated by a common soul. These
  acute supplementary notions of mine go far to get rid of the difficulty
  which some have found in the common theory that the soul inhabits the
  body: it has been <span class="correction" title="text reads `started'"
  >stated</span> that there is, somewhere or another, a world of souls
  which communicate with their bodies by wondrous filaments of a nature
  neither mental nor material, but of a <i>tertium quid</i> fit to be a
  go-between; as it were a corporispiritual copper encased in a
  spiritucorporeal gutta-percha. My theory is that every soul is everywhere
  <i>in posse</i>, as the schoolmen said, but not anywhere <i>in actu</i>,
  except where it finds one of its bodies. These <i>a priori</i>
  difficulties being thus removed, the system of particle-worlds is reduced
  to a dry question of fact, and remitted to the decision of the
  microscope. And a grand field may thus be opened, as optical science
  progresses! For the worlds are not fac-similes of ours in time: there is
  not a moment of <i>our</i> past, and not a moment of <i>our</i> future,
  but is the <i>present</i> of one or more of the particles. A will write
  the death of Cæsar, and B the building of the Pyramids, by actual
  observation of the processes with a power of a thousand millions; C will
  discover the commencement of the Millennium, and D the <!-- Page 193

  <p>The History of the Supernatural in all ages and nations, and in all

  <p>Mr. Howitt is a preacher of spiritualism. He cements an enormous
  collection of alleged facts with a vivid outpouring of exhortation, and
  an unsparing flow of sarcasm against the scorners of all classes. He and
  the Rev. J. Smith<a name="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a>
  (<i>ante</i>, 1854) are the most thoroughgoing universalists of all the
  writers I know on spiritualism. If either can insert the small end of the
  wedge, he will not let you off one fraction of the conclusion that all
  countries, in all ages, have been the theaters of one vast spiritual
  display. And I suspect that this consequence cannot be avoided, if any
  part of the system be of truly spiritual origin. Mr. Howitt treats the
  philosophers either as ignorant babies, or as conscious spirit-fearers:
  and seems much inclined to accuse the world at large of dreading, lest by
  the actual presence of the other world their Christianity should imbibe a
  spiritual element which would unfit it for the purposes of their
  lives.</p>

  <p>This is a work on Spiritual Manifestations. The author upholds the
  facts for spiritual phenomena: the prefator suspends his opinion as to
  the cause, though he upholds the facts. The work begins systematically
  with the lower class of phenomena, proceeds to the higher class, and
  offers a theory, suggested by the facts, of the connection of the present
  and future life. I agree in the main with A.&nbsp;B.; but can, of course, make
  none but horrescent reference to his treatment of the smaller
  philosophers. This is always the way with your paradoxers: they behave
  towards orthodoxy as the thresher fish behaves towards the whale. But if
  true, as is said, that the drubbing clears the great fish of parasites
  which he could not otherwise get rid of, he ought to bear no malice. This
  preface retorts a little of that contempt which the "philosophical world"
  has bestowed with heaped measure upon those who have believed their
  senses, and have drawn natural, even if hasty, inferences. There is
  philosophercraft as well as priestcraft, both from one source, both of
  one spirit. In English cities and towns, the minister of religion has
  been tamed: so many weapons are bared against him when he obtrudes his
  office in a dictatory manner, that, as a rule, there is no more quiet and
  modest member of society than the urban clergyman. Domination over
  religious belief is reserved for the exclusive use of those who admit the
  right: the rare exception to this mode of behavior is laughed at as a
  bigot, or shunned as a nuisance. But the overbearing minister of nature,
  who snaps you with <i>unphilosophical</i> as the clergyman once
  frightened you with <i>infidel</i>, is still a recognized member of
  society, wants taming, and will get it. He wears the priest's cast-off
  <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>[195]</span>clothes, dyed to escape detection: the
  better sort of philosophers would gladly set him to square the
  circle.</p>

  <p>The book just named appeared about the same time as this Budget began
  in the <i>Athenæum</i>. It was commonly attributed, the book to my wife,
  the preface to myself. Some time after, our names were actually announced
  by the publisher, who ought to know. It will be held to confirm this
  statement that I announce our having in our possession some twenty
  reviews of different lengths, and of all characters: who ever collects a
  number of reviews of a book, except the author?</p>

  <p>A great many of these reviews settle the matter <i>a priori</i>. If
  there had been spirits in the matter, they would have done this, and they
  would not have done that. Jean Meslier<a name="NtA_340"
  href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> said there could be no God over all,
  for, <i>if</i> there had been one, He would have established a universal
  religion. If J. M. <i>knew</i> that, J.&nbsp;M. was right: but if J.&nbsp;M. did
  not know that, then J.&nbsp;M. was on the "high priori road," and may be left
  to his course. The same to all who know what spirits would do and would
  not do.</p>

  <p>A.&nbsp;B. very distinctly said that he knew some of the asserted facts,
  believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know whether they
  were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. This
  he said as clearly as I could have said it myself. But a great many
  persons cannot understand such a frame of mind: their own apparatus is a
  kind of spirit-level, and their conclusion on any subject is the little
  bubble, which is always at one end or the other. Many of the reviewers
  declare that A.&nbsp;B. is a secret believer in the spirit-hypothesis: and one
  of them wishes that he had "endorsed his opinion more boldly." According
  to this reviewer, any one who writes "I boldly <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>[196]</span>say I am unable to
  choose," contradicts himself. In truth, a person who does say it has a
  good deal of courage, for each side believes that he secretly favors the
  other; and both look upon him as a coward. In spite of all this, A.&nbsp;B.
  boldly repeats that he feels assured of many of the facts of
  <i>spiritualism</i>, and that he cannot pretend to affirm or deny
  anything about their cause.</p>

  <p>The great bulk of the illogical part of the educated
  community&mdash;whether majority or minority I know not; perhaps six of
  one and half-a-dozen of the other&mdash;have not power to make a
  distinction, cannot be made to take a distinction, and of course, never
  attempt to shake a distinction. With them all such things are evasions,
  subterfuges, come-offs, loopholes, etc. They would hang a man for
  horse-stealing under a statute against sheep-stealing; and would laugh at
  you if you quibbled about the distinction between a horse and a sheep. I
  divide the illogical&mdash;I mean people who have not that amount of
  natural use of sound inference which is really not uncommon&mdash;into
  three classes:&mdash;First class, three varieties: the Niddy, the Noddy,
  and the Noodle. Second class, three varieties: the Niddy-Noddy, the
  Niddy-Noodle, and the Noddy-Noodle. Third class, undivided: the
  Niddy-Noddy-Noodle. No person has a right to be angry with me for more
  than one of these subdivisions.</p>

  <p>The want of distinction was illustrated to me, when a boy, about 1820,
  by the report of a trial which I shall never forget: boys read newspapers
  more keenly than men. Every now and then a bench of country magistrates
  rather astonishes the town populations, accustomed to rub their brains<a
  name="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> against one another.
  Such a story as the following would, <!-- Page 197 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>in our day, bring down
  grave remarks from above: but I write of the olden (or Eldon<a
  name="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a>) time, when nothing
  but conviction in a court of record would displace a magistrate. In that
  day the third-class amalgamator of distinct things was often on the bench
  of quarter-sessions.</p>

  <p>An attorney was charged with having been out at night poaching. A
  clear <i>alibi</i> was established; and perjury had certainly been
  committed. The whole gave reason to suspect that some ill-willers thought
  the bench disliked the attorney so much that any conviction was certain
  on any evidence. The bench did dislike the attorney: but not to the
  extent of thinking he could snare any partridges in the fields while he
  was asleep in bed, except the dream-partridges which are not always
  protected by the dream-laws. So the chairman said, "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,
  you are discharged; but you should consider this one of the most
  fortunate days of your life." The attorney indignantly remonstrated, but
  the magistrate was right; for he said, "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, you have
  frequently been employed to defend poachers: have you been careful to
  impress upon them the enormity of their practices?" It appeared in a
  wrangling conversation that the magistrates saw little moral difference
  between poaching and being a poacher's professional defender without
  lecturing him on his wickedness: but they admitted with reluctance, that
  there was a legal distinction; and the brain of N<sup>3</sup> could no
  further go. This is nearly fifty years ago; and Westernism was not quite
  extinct. If the present lords of the hills and the valleys want to shine,
  let them publish a true history of their own order. I am just old enough
  to remember some of the last of the squires and parsons who protested
  against teaching the poor to read and write. They now write books for the
  working classes, give them lectures, and the like. There is now no class,
  as a class, more highly educated, broadly educated, and deeply educated,
  <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span>than those who were, in old times, best
  described as partridge-popping squireens. I have myself, when a boy,
  heard Old Booby speaking with pride of Young Booby as having too high a
  spirit to be confined to books: and I suspected that his dislike to
  teaching the poor arose in fact from a feeling that they would, if taught
  a little, pass his heir.</p>

  <p>A.&nbsp;B. recommended the spirit-theory as an hypothesis on which to
  ground inquiry; that is, as the means of suggestion for the direction of
  inquiry. Every person who knows anything of the progress of physics
  understands what is meant; but not the reviewers I speak of. Many of them
  consider A.&nbsp;B. as <i>adopting</i> the spirit-hypothesis. The whole book
  was written, as both the authors point out, to suggest inquiry to those
  who are curious; C.&nbsp;D. firmly believing, A.&nbsp;B. as above. Neither C.&nbsp;D.
  nor A.&nbsp;B. make any other pretence. Both dwell upon the absence of
  authentications and the suppression of names as utterly preventive of
  anything like proof. And A.&nbsp;B. says that his reader "will give him
  credit, if not himself a goose, for seeing that the tender of an
  anonymous cheque would be of equal effect, whether drawn on the Bank of
  England or on Aldgate Pump." By this test a number of the reviewers are
  found to be geese: for they take the authors as offering proof, and
  insist, against the authors, on the very point on which the authors had
  themselves insisted beforehand.</p>

  <p>Leaving aside imperceptions of this kind, I proceed to notice a
  clerical and medical review. I have lived much in the middle ages,
  especially since the invention of printing; and from thence I have
  brought away a high respect for and grateful recollection of&mdash;the
  priest in everything but theology, and the physician in everything but
  medicine. The professional harness was unfavorable to all progress,
  except on a beaten road; the professional blinkers prevented all but the
  beaten road from being seen: the professional reins were pulled at the
  slightest attempt to quicken pace, even on the permitted path; and the
  <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>[199]</span>professional whip was heavily laid on at
  the slightest attempt to diverge. But when the intelligent man of either
  class turned his attention out of his ordinary work, he had, in most
  cases, the freshness and vigor of a boy at play, and like the boy, he
  felt his freedom all the more from the contrast of school-restraint.</p>

  <p>In the case of medicine, and physics generally, the learned were, in
  some essential points, more rational than many of their present
  impugners. They pass for having put <i>a priori</i> obstacles in the way
  of progress: they might rather be reproved for too much belief in
  progress obtained by <i>a priori</i> means. They would have shouted with
  laughter at a dunce who&mdash;in a review I read, but without making a
  note&mdash;declared that he would not believe his senses except when what
  they showed him was capable of explanation upon some known principle. I
  have seen such stuff as this attributed to the schoolmen; but only by
  those who knew nothing about them. The following, which I wrote some
  years ago, will give a notion of a distinction worth remembering. It is
  addressed to the authorities of the College of Physicians.</p>

  <p>"The ignominy of the word <i>empiric</i> dates from the ages in which
  scholastic philosophy deduced physical consequences <i>a
  priori</i>;&mdash;the ages in which, because a lion is strong, rubbing
  with lion's fat would have been held an infallible tonic. In those happy
  days, if a physician had given decoction of a certain bark, only because
  in numberless instances that decoction had been found to strengthen the
  patient, he would have been a miserable empiric. Not that the colleges
  would have passed over his returns because they were empirical: they knew
  better. They were as skilful in finding causes for facts, as facts for
  causes. The president and the elects of that day would have walked out
  into the forest with a rope, and would have pulled heartily at the tree
  which yielded the bark: nor would they ever have left it until they had
  pulled out a legitimate <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>[200]</span>reason. If the tree had resisted all their
  efforts, they would have said, 'Ah! no wonder now; the bark of a strong
  tree makes a strong man.' But if they had managed to serve the tree as
  you would like to serve hom&oelig;opathy, then it would have been 'We
  might have guessed it; all the <i>virtus roborativa</i> has settled in
  the bark.' They admitted, as we know from Molière, the <i>virtus
  dormitiva</i><a name="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> of
  opium, for no other reason than that opium <i>facit dormire</i>.<a
  name="NtA_344" href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> Had the medicine not
  been previously <i>known</i>, they would, strange as it may seem to
  modern pharmacop&oelig;ists, have accorded a <i>virtus dormitiva</i> to
  the new <i>facit dormire</i>. On this point they have been
  misapprehended. They were prone to infer <i>facit</i> from a
  <i>virtus</i> imagined <i>a priori</i>; and they were ready in supplying
  <i>facit</i> in favor of an orthodox <i>virtus</i>. They might have gone
  so far, for example, under pre-notional impressions, as the alliterative
  allopath, who, when maintenance of truth was busy opposing the progress
  of science called <i>vaccination</i>, declared that some of its patients
  coughed like cows, and bellowed like bulls; but they never refused to
  find <i>virtus</i> when <i>facit</i> came upon them, no matter whence.
  They would rather have accepted Tenterden steeple than have rejected the
  Goodwin Sands. They would have laughed their modern imitators to scorn:
  but as they are not here, we do it for them.</p>

  <p>"The man of our day&mdash;the <i>a priori</i> philosopher&mdash;tries
  the question whether opium can cause sleep by finding out in the recesses
  of his own noddle whether the drug can have a dormitive power: Well! but
  did not the schoolman do the same? He did; but mark the distinction. The
  schoolman had recourse to first principles, when there was no opium to
  try it by: our man settles the point in the same way <i>with a lump of
  opium before him</i>. The schoolman shifted his principles with his
  facts: the man of our drawing-rooms will fight facts with his principles,
  just as an old <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>[201]</span>physician would have done in actual
  practice, with the rod of his <i>Church</i> at his back.</p>

  <p>"The story about Galileo&mdash;which seems to have been either a joke
  made against him, or by him&mdash;illustrates this. <i>Nature abhors a
  vacuum</i> was the explanation of the water rising in a pump: but they
  found that the water would not rise more than 32 feet. They asked for
  explanation: what does the satirist make the schoolmen say? That the
  stoppage is <i>not</i> a fact, because nature abhors a vacuum? No! but
  that the principle should be that nature abhors a vacuum as far as 32
  feet. And this is what would have been done.</p>

  <p>"There are still among us both priests and physicians who would have
  belonged, had they lived three or four centuries ago, to the glorious
  band of whom I have spoken, the majority of the intelligent, working well
  for mankind out of the professional pursuit. But we have a great many who
  have helped to abase their classes. Go where we may, we find specimens of
  the lower orders of the ministry of religion and the ministry of health
  showing themselves smaller than the small of other pursuits. And how is
  this? First, because each profession is entered upon a mere working smack
  of its knowledge, without any depth of education, general or
  professional. Not that this is the whole explanation, nor in itself
  objectionable: the great mass of the world must be tended, soul and body,
  by those who are neither Hookers<a name="NtA_345"
  href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> nor Harveys<a name="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a>: let such persons not venture
  <i>ultra crepidam</i>, and they are useful and respectable. But,
  secondly, there is a vast upheaving of thought from the depths of
  commonplace learning. I am a clergyman! Sir! I am a medical man! Sir! and
  forthwith the nature of things is picked to pieces, and there is a race,
  with the last the winner, between Philosophy mounted on Folly's donkey,
  and Folly mounted on Philosophy's donkey. How fortunate <!-- Page 202
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>[202]</span>it is for Law
  that her battles are fought by politicians in the Houses of Parliament.
  Not that it is better done: but then <i>politics</i> bears the
  blame."</p>

  <p>I now come to the medical review. After a quantity of remark which has
  been already disposed of, the writer shows Greek learning, a field in
  which the old physician would have had a little knowledge. A.&nbsp;B., for the
  joke's sake, had left untranslated, as being too deep, a remarkably easy
  sentence of Aristotle, to the effect that what has happened was possible,
  for if impossible it would not have happened. The reviewer, in "simple
  astonishment,"&mdash;it was simple&mdash;at the pretended
  incapacity&mdash;I was told by A.&nbsp;B. that the joke was intended to draw
  out a reviewer&mdash;translates:&mdash;He says that this sentence is
  A.&nbsp;B.'s summing up of the evidence of Spiritualism. Now, being a sort of
  <i>alter ego</i><a name="NtA_347" href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> of
  A.&nbsp;B., I do declare that he is not such a fool as to rest the evidence of
  Spiritualism&mdash;the <i>spirit explanation</i>&mdash;upon the
  occurrence of certain facts proving the possibility of those very facts.
  In truth, A.&nbsp;B. refuses to receive spiritualism, while he receives the
  facts: this is the gist of his whole preface, which simply admits
  spiritualism among the qualified candidates, and does not know what
  others there may be.</p>

  <p>The reviewer speaks of Aristotle as "that clear thinker and concise
  writer." I strongly suspect that his knowledge of Aristotle was limited
  to the single sentence which he had translated or got translated.
  Aristotle is concise in <i>phrase</i>, not in book, and is powerful and
  profound in thought: but no one who knows that his writing, all we have
  of him, is the very opposite of clear, will pretend to decide that he
  thought clearly. As his writing, so probably was his thought; and his
  books are, if not anything but clear, at least anything good but clear.
  Nobody thinks them clear except a person who always clears difficulties:
  which I have no doubt was the reviewer's habit; that is, if he ever took
  the field <!-- Page 203 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page203"></a>[203]</span>at all. The gentleman who read Euclid, all
  except the As and Bs and the pictures of scratches and scrawls, is the
  type of a numerous class.</p>

  <p>The reviewer finds that the word <i>amosgepotically</i>, used by
  A.&nbsp;B., is utterly mysterious and incomprehensible. He hopes his
  translation of the bit of Greek will shield him from imputation of
  ignorance: and thinks the word may be referred to the "obscure dialect"
  out of which sprung <i>aneroid</i>, <i>kalos geusis sauce</i>, and
  <i>Anaxyridian trousers</i>. To lump the first two phrases with the third
  smacks of ignorance in a Greek critic; for <span title="anaxuridia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&alpha;&xi;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&delta;&iota;&alpha;</span>,
  <i>breeches</i>, would have turned up in the lexicon; and <i>kalos
  geusis</i>, though absurd, is not obscure. And <span title="amôsgepôs" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&mu;&omega;&sigma;&gamma;&epsilon;&pi;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>somehow or other</i>, is as easily found as <span title="anaxuridia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&alpha;&xi;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&delta;&iota;&alpha;</span>.
  The word <i>aneroid</i>, I admit, has puzzled better scholars than the
  critic: but never one who knows the unscholarlike way in which words
  ending in <span title="eidês" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span> have been rendered. The
  <i>aneroid barometer</i> does <i>not</i> use a column of air in the same
  way as the old instrument. Now <span title="aeroeidês" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>&mdash;properly
  <i>like</i> the atmosphere&mdash;is by scientific non-scholarship
  rendered having to do with the atmosphere; and <span title="anaeroeidês" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&alpha;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>&mdash;say
  <i>anaëroid</i>&mdash;denies having to do with the atmosphere; a nice
  thing to say of an instrument which is to measure the weight of the
  atmosphere. One more absurdity, and we have <i>aneroid</i>, and there you
  are. The critic ends with a declaration that nothing in the book shakes
  his faith in a <i>Quarterly</i> reviewer who said that suspension of
  opinion, until further evidence arrives, is justifiable: a strange
  summing up for an article which insists upon utter rejection being
  unavoidable.<a name="NtA_348" href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a> The
  expressed aim of both A.&nbsp;B. and C.&nbsp;D. was to excite inquiry, and get
  further evidence: until this is done, neither asks for a verdict.</p>

  <p>Oh where! and oh where! is old Medicine's learning gone! There
  <i>was</i> some in the days of yore, when Popery <!-- Page 204 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[204]</span>was on! And it's oh!
  for some Greek, just to find a word upon! The reviewer who, lexicon in
  hand, can neither make out <i>anaxyridical</i>, <i>amosgepotical</i>,
  <i>kalos geusis</i>, nor distinguish them from <i>aneroid</i>, cannot be
  trusted when he says he has translated a sentence of Aristotle. He may
  have done it; but, as he says of spiritualism, we must suspend our
  opinion until further evidence shall arrive.</p>

  <p>We now come to the theological review. I have before alluded to the
  faults of logic which are Protestant necessities: but I never said that
  Protestant argument had <i>nothing but</i> paralogism. The writer before
  me attains this completeness: from beginning to end he is of that
  confusion and perversion which, as applied to interpretation of the New
  Testament, is so common as to pass unnoticed by sermon-hearers; but
  which, when applied out of church, is exposed with laughter in all
  subjects except theology. I shall take one instance, putting some words
  in italics.</p>

  <p>The possibility of a <i>yet unimagined</i> cause is insisted on in
  several places. On this ground it is argued by A.&nbsp;B. that spiritualists
  are "incautious" for giving in at once to the spirit doctrine. But, it is
  said, they may be justified by the philosophers, who make the flint
  <i>axes</i>, as they call them, to be the works of men, because no one
  can see <i>what else they can be</i>. This kind of adoption,
  <i>condemned</i> as a conclusion, is <i>approved</i> as a provisional
  theory, suggestive of direction of inquiry: experience having shown that
  <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>[205]</span>inquiry directed by a <i>wrong</i> theory
  has led to more good than inquiry without any theory at all. All this
  A.&nbsp;B. has fully set forth, in several pages. On it the reviewer remarks
  that "with infinite satisfaction he tries to justify his view of the case
  by urging that there is no other way of accounting for it; after the
  fashion of the philosophers of our own day, who conclude that certain
  flints found in the drift are the work of men, because the geologist does
  not see what else they can be." After this twist of meaning, the reviewer
  proceeds to say, and A.&nbsp;B. would certainly join him, "There is no need to
  combat any such mode of reasoning as this, because it would apply with
  equal force and justice to any theory whatever, however fantastic,
  profane, or silly." And so, having shown how the reviewer has hung
  himself, I leave him funipendulous.</p>

  <p>One instance more, and I have done. A reviewer, not theological,
  speaking of the common argument that things which are derided are not
  <i>therefore</i> to be rejected, writes as follows:&mdash;"It might as
  well be said that they who laughed at Jenner<a name="NtA_349"
  href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> and vaccination were, in a certain
  but very unsatisfactory way, witnesses to the possible excellence of the
  system of St. John Long."<a name="NtA_350"
  href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> Of course it <i>might</i>: and of
  course it <i>is</i> said by all people of common sense. In introducing
  the word "possible," the reviewer has hit the point: I suspect that this
  word was introduced during revision, to put the sentence into fighting
  order; hurry preventing it being seen that the sentence was thus made to
  fight on the wrong side. Jenner, who was laughed at, was right;
  therefore, it is not impossible&mdash;that is, it is
  <i>possible</i>&mdash;that a derided system may be right. Mark the three
  gradations: <i>in medio tutissimus ibis</i>.<a name="NtA_351"
  href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>[206]</span></p>

  <p><i>Reviewer.</i>&mdash;If a system be derided, it is no ground of
  suspense that derided systems have turned out true: if it were, you would
  suspend your opinion about St. John Long on account of
  Jenner.&mdash;<i>Ans.</i> You ought to do so, as to <i>possibility</i>;
  and <i>before examination</i>; not with the notion that J. proves St. J.
  <i>probable</i>; only <i>possible</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Common Sense.</i>&mdash;The past emergence of truths out of derided
  systems proves that there is a practical certainty of like occurrence to
  come. But, inasmuch as a hundred speculative fooleries are started for
  one truth, the mind is permitted to approach the examination of any one
  given novelty with a bias against it of a hundred to one: and this
  permission is given because so it will be, leave or no leave. Every one
  has licence not to jump over the moon.</p>

  <p><i>Paradoxer.</i>&mdash;Great men have been derided, and I am derided:
  which proves that my system ought to be adopted. This is a summary of all
  the degrees in which paradoxers contend for the former derision of truths
  now established, giving their systems <i>probability</i>. I annex a
  paragraph which D&nbsp;[e &amp;c.] inserted in the <i>Athenæum</i> of October
  23, 1847.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"<i>Discoverers and Discoveries.</i></p>

  <p>"Aristotle once sent his servant to the cellar to fetch
  wine:&mdash;and the fellow brought him back small beer. The Stagirite
  (who knew the difference) called him a blockhead. 'Sir,' said the man,
  'all I can say is, that I found it in the cellar.' The philosopher
  muttered to himself that an affirmative conclusion could not be proved in
  the second figure,&mdash;and Mrs. Aristotle, who was by, was not less
  effective in her remark, that small beer was not wine because it was in
  the same cellar. Both were right enough: and our philosophers might take
  a lesson from either&mdash;for they insinuate an affirmative conclusion
  in the second figure. Great discoverers have been little valued by
  established <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page207"></a>[207]</span>schools,&mdash;and they are little valued.
  The results of true science are strange at first,&mdash;and so are
  their's. Many great men have opposed existing notions,&mdash;and so do
  they. All great men were obscure at first,&mdash;and they are obscure.
  Thinking men doubt,&mdash;and they doubt. Their small beer, I grant, has
  come out of the same cellar as the wine; but this is not enough. If they
  had let it stand awhile in the old wine-casks, it might have imbibed a
  little of the flavor."</p>

  <p>There are better reviews than I have noticed; which, though entirely
  dissenting, are unassailable on their own principles. What I have given
  represents five-sixths of the whole. But it must be confessed that the
  fraction of fairness and moderation and suspended opinion which the
  doctrine of <i>Spirit Manifestations</i> has met with&mdash;even in the
  lower reviews&mdash;is strikingly large compared to what would have been
  the case fifty years ago. It is to be hoped that our popular and
  periodical literatures are giving us one thinker created for twenty geese
  double-feathered: if this hope be realized, we shall do! Seeing all that
  I see, I am not prepared to go the length of a friend of mine who, after
  reading a good specimen of the lower reviewing, exclaimed&mdash;Oh! if
  all the fools in the world could be rolled up into one fool, what a
  reviewer he would make!</p>

  <p>I shall not give any account of this curious calendar, with all its
  changes and symbols. But there is one proposal, which, could we alter the
  general notions of time&mdash;a thing of very dubious
  possibility&mdash;would be convenient. The week is made to wax and wane,
  culminating on the Sunday, <!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page208"></a>[208]</span>which comes in the middle. Thursday,
  Friday, Saturday, are ascending or waxing days; Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday, are descending or waning days. Our six days, lumped together
  after the great distinguishing day, Sunday, are too many to be distinctly
  thought of together: a division of three preceding and three following
  the day of most note would be much more easily used. But all this comes
  too late. It may be, nevertheless, that some individuals may be able to
  adjust their affairs with advantage by referring Thursday, Friday,
  Saturday, to the following Sunday, and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, to the
  preceding Sunday. But M. Arson's proposal to alter the names of the days
  is no more necessary than it is practicable.</p>

  <p>I am not to enter anything I do not possess. The reader therefore will
  not learn from me the feats of many a man-at-arms in these subjects. He
  must be content, unless he will bestir himself for himself, not to know
  how Mr. Patrick Cody trisects the angle at Mullinavat, or Professor
  Recalcati squares the circle at Milan. But this last is to be done by
  subscription, at five francs a head: a banker is named who guarantees
  restitution if the solution be not perfectly rigorous; the banker
  himself, I suppose, is the judge. I have heard of a man of business who
  settled the circle in this way: if it can be reduced to a debtor and
  creditor account, it can certainly be done; if not, it is not worth
  doing. Montucla will give the accounts of the lawsuits which wagers on
  the problem have produced in France.</p>

  <p>Neither will I enter at length upon the success of the new squarer who
  advertises (Nov. 1863) in a country paper that, having read that the
  circular ratio was undetermined, "I thought it very strange that so many
  great scholars in all ages should have failed in finding the true ratio,
  and have been determined to try myself.... I am about to secure the <!--
  Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page209"></a>[209]</span>benefit of the discovery, so until then
  the public cannot know my new and true ratio." I have been informed that
  this trial makes the diameter to the circumference as 64 to 201, giving
  <span class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3.140625 exactly. The result was obtained
  by the discoverer in three weeks after he first heard of the existence of
  the difficulty. This quadrator has since published a little slip, and
  entered it at Stationers' Hall. He says he has done it by actual
  measurement; and I hear from a private source that he uses a disk of 12
  inches diameter, which he rolls upon a straight rail. Mr. James Smith did
  the same at one time; as did also his partisan at Bordeaux. We have,
  then, both 3.125 and 3.140625, by actual measurement. The second result
  is more than the first by about one part in 200. The second rolling is a
  very creditable one; it is about as much below the mark as Archimedes was
  above it. Its performer is a joiner, who evidently knows well what he is
  about when he measures; he is not wrong by 1 in 3,000.</p>

  <p>The reader will smile at the quiet self-sufficiency with which "I have
  been determined to try myself" follows the information that "so many
  great scholars in all ages" have failed. It is an admirable spirit, when
  accompanied by common sense and uncommon self-knowledge. When I was an
  undergraduate there was a little attendant in the library who gave me the
  following,&mdash;"As to cleaning this library, Sir, if I have spoken to
  the Master once about it, I have spoken fifty times: but it is of no use;
  he will not employ <i>littery</i> men; and so I am obliged to look after
  it myself."</p>

  <p>I do not think I have mentioned the bright form of quadrature in which
  a square is made equal to a circle by making each side equal to a quarter
  of the circumference. The last squarer of this kind whom I have seen
  figures in the last number of the <i>Athenæum</i> for 1855: he says the
  thing is no longer a <i>problem</i>, but an <i>axiom</i>. He does not
  know that the area of the circle is greater than that of any other figure
  of the same circuit. This any one might see without <!-- Page 210
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>[210]</span>mathematics.
  How is it possible that the figure of greatest area should have any one
  length in its circuit unlike in form to any other part of the same
  length?</p>

  <p>The feeling which tempts persons to this problem is that which, in
  romance, made it impossible for a knight to pass a castle which belonged
  to a giant or an enchanter. I once gave a lecture on the subject: a
  gentleman who was introduced to it by what I said remarked, loud enough
  to be heard by all around, "Only prove to me that it is impossible, and I
  will set about it this very evening."</p>

  <p>This rinderpest of geometry cannot be cured, when once it has seated
  itself in the system: all that can be done is to apply what the learned
  call prophylactics to those who are yet sound. When once the virus gets
  into the brain, the victim goes round the flame like a moth; first one
  way and then the other, beginning where he ended, and ending where he
  begun: thus verifying the old line</p>

  <p>Every mathematician knows that scores of methods, differing altogether
  from each other in process, all end in this mysterious 3.14159..., which
  insists on calling itself the circumference to a unit of diameter. A
  reader who is competent to follow processes of arithmetic may be easily
  satisfied that such methods do actually exist. I will give a sketch,
  carried out to a few figures, of three: the first two I never met with in
  my reading; the third is the old method of Vieta.<a name="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> [I find that both the first and
  second methods are contained in a theorem of Euler.]</p>

  <p>What Mr. James Smith says of these methods is worth noting. He says I
  have given three "<i>fancy</i> proofs" of the value of <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>: he evidently takes me to be offering
  demonstration. He proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"His first proof is traceable to the diameter of a circle <!-- Page
  211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>[211]</span>of radius
  1. His second, to the side of any inscribed equilateral triangle to a
  circle of radius 1. His third, to a radius of a circle of diameter 1.
  Now, it may be frankly admitted that we can arrive at the same result by
  many other modes of arithmetical calculation, all of which may be shown
  to have some sort of relation to a circle; but, after all, these results
  are mere exhibitions of the properties of numbers, and have no more to do
  with the ratio of diameter to circumference in a circle than the price of
  sugar with the mean height of spring tides. (<i>Corr.</i> Oct. 21,
  1865)."</p>

  <p>I quote this because it is one of the few cases&mdash;other than
  absolute assumption of the conclusion&mdash;in which Mr. Smith's
  conclusions would be true if his premise were true. Had I given what
  follows as <i>proof</i>, it would have been properly remarked, that I had
  only exhibited properties of numbers. But I took care to tell my reader
  that I was only going to show him <i>methods</i> which end in 3.14159....
  The proofs that these methods establish the value of <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> are for those who will read and can
  understand.</p>

  <p>3. Take the square root of ½; the square root of half of one more than
  this; the square root of half of one more <!-- Page 213 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>[213]</span>than the last; and so
  on, until we come as near to unity as the number of figures chosen will
  permit. Multiply all the results together, and divide 2 by the product:
  the quotient is an approximation to the circumference when the diameter
  is unity. Taking aim at four figures, that is, working to five figures to
  secure accuracy in the fourth, we have .70712 for the square root of ½;
  .92390 for the square root of half one more than .70712; and so on,
  through .98080, .99520, .99880, .99970, .99992, .99998. The product of
  the eight results is .63667; divide 2 by this, and the quotient is
  3.1413..., of which four figures are correct. Had the product been
  .636363... instead of .63667..., the famous result of Archimedes,
  22-7ths, would have been accurately true. It is singular that no
  cyclometer maintains that Archimedes hit it exactly.</p>

  <p>A literary journal could hardly admit as much as the preceding, if it
  stood alone. But in my present undertaking it passes as the
  halfpennyworth of bread to many gallons of sack. Many more methods might
  be given, all ending in the same result, let that result mean what it
  may.</p>

  <p>Now since dozens of methods, to which dozens more might be added at
  pleasure, concur in giving one and the same result; and since these
  methods are declared by all who have shown knowledge of mathematics to be
  <i>demonstrated</i>: it is not asking too much of a person who has just a
  little knowledge of the first elements that he should learn more, and put
  his hand upon the error, before he intrudes his assertion of the
  existence of error upon those who have given more time and attention to
  it than himself, and who are in possession, over and above many
  demonstrations, of many consequences verifying each other, of which he
  can know nothing. This is all that is required. Let any one square the
  circle, and persuade his friends, if he and they please: let him print,
  and let all read who choose. But let him abstain from intruding himself
  upon those who have been satisfied by existing demonstration, until he is
  prepared <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>[214]</span>to lay his finger on the point in which
  existing demonstration is wrong. Let him also say what this mysterious
  3.14159... really is, which comes in at every door and window, and down
  every chimney, calling itself the circumference to a unit of diameter.
  This most impudent and successful impostor holds false title-deeds in his
  hands, and invites examination: surely those who can find out the
  rightful owner are equally able to detect the forgery. All the quadrators
  are agreed that, be the right what it may, 3.14159... is wrong. It would
  be well if they would put their heads together, and say what this wrong
  result really means. The mathematicians of all ages have tried all manner
  of processes, with one object in view, and by methods which are admitted
  to yield demonstration in countless cases. They have all arrived at one
  result. A large number of opponents unite in declaring this result wrong,
  and all agree in two points: first, in differing among themselves;
  secondly, in declining to point out what that curious result really is
  which the mathematical methods all agree in giving.</p>

  <p>Most of the quadrators are not aware that it has been fully
  demonstrated that no two numbers whatsoever can represent the ratio of
  the diameter to the circumference with perfect accuracy. When therefore
  we are told that either 8 to 25 or 64 to 201 is the true ratio, we know
  that it is no such thing, without the necessity of examination. The point
  that is left open, as not fully demonstrated to be impossible, is the
  <i>geometrical</i> quadrature, the determination of the circumference by
  the straight line and circle, used as in Euclid. The general run of
  circle-squarers, hearing that the quadrature is not pronounced to be
  <i>demonstratively</i> impossible, imagine that the <i>arithmetical</i>
  quadrature is open to their ingenuity. Before attempting the arithmetical
  problem, they ought to acquire knowledge enough to read Lambert's<a
  name="NtA_355" href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> demonstration (last
  given in Brewster's<a name="NtA_356" href="#Nt_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a>
  translation <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page215"></a>[215]</span>of Legendre's<a name="NtA_357"
  href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> Geometry) and, if they can, to refute
  it. [It will be given in an Appendix.] Probably some have begun this way,
  and have caught a Tartar who has refused to let them go: I have never
  heard of any one who, in producing his own demonstration, has laid his
  finger on the faulty part of Lambert's investigation. This is the answer
  to those who think that the mathematicians treat the arithmetical
  squarers too lightly, and that as some person may succeed at last, all
  attempts should be examined. Those who have so thought, not knowing that
  there is demonstration on the point, will probably admit that a person
  who contradicts a theorem of which the demonstration has been
  acknowledged for a century by all who have alluded to it as read by
  themselves, may reasonably be required to point out the error before he
  demands attention to his own result.</p>

  <p><i>Apopempsis of the Tutelaries.</i>&mdash;Again and again I am told
  that I spend too much time and trouble upon my two tutelaries: but when I
  come to my summing-up I shall make it appear that I have a purpose. Some
  say I am too hard upon them: but this is quite a mistake. Both of them
  beat little Oliver himself in the art and science of asking for more; but
  without Oliver's excuse, for I had given good allowance. Both began with
  me, not I with them: and both knew what they had to expect when they
  applied for a second helping.</p>

  to do with such a testy person? [Wrong word; no testy person can manage
  cool and consecutive ridicule. Quære, what is this word? Is it anything
  but a corruption of the obsolete word <i>tetchy</i> of the same <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `meaing'">meaning</span>? Some think
  <i>touchy</i> is our modern form of <i>tetchy</i>, which I greatly
  doubt]. My answer is, the poor man is lamentably ignorant; he is not only
  so, but 'out of the way' [quite true; my readers know me by this time for
  an out-of-the-way person. What other could tackle my squad of paradoxers?
  What other would undertake the job?] Can he be brought back and form one
  of those who in Ezekiel 37 ch. have the Spirit breathed into them and
  live.... Have I any other feeling towards you except that of peace and
  goodwill? [Not to your distinct knowledge; but in all those who send
  people to 'the other place' for contempt of their interpretations, there
  is a lurking wish which is father to the thought; 'you <i>will</i> be
  d&mdash;&mdash;d' and 'you <i>be</i> d&mdash;d' are Siamese twins]. Of
  course your sneer at 666 brought plain words; but when men meddle with
  what they do not understand (not having the double <i>Vahu</i>) they must
  be dealt with faithfully by those who do.... [They must; which justifies
  the Budget of Paradoxes: but no occasion to send them anywhere; no
  preachee and floggee too, as the negro said]. Many will find the text
  Prov. i. 26 fully realized. [All this contains distinct assumption of a
  right 'of course' to declare accursed those who do not respect the
  writer's vagary].... If I could but get the <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="A" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;</bdo></span>, the Ox-head, which in Old
  Hebrew was just the Latin Digamma, F, out <!-- Page 217 --><span

  then Thau you with the Thau of Ezekiel ix, 4, the <span
  class="grk">&chi;</span>, then you would bear the number of a man! But
  this is too hard for me, although not so for the Lord! Jer. xxxii. 17....
  And now a word: is ridicule the right thing in so solemn a matter as the
  discussion of Holy Writ? [Is food for ridicule the right thing? Did I
  discuss Holy Writ? I did not: I concussed profane scribble. Even the
  Doctor did not <i>discuss</i>; he only enunciated and denunciated out of
  the mass of inferences which a mystical head has found premises for in
  the Bible]."</p>

  <p>Mystical hermeneutics may be put to good use by out-of-the-way people.
  They may be made to call the attention <!-- Page 220 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>[220]</span>of the many to a
  distinction well known among the learned. The books of the New Testament
  have been for 1,500 years divided into two classes: the
  <i>acknowledged</i> (<span title="homologoumena" class="grk"
  >&#x1F41;&mu;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;</span>),
  which it has always been paradox not to receive; and the
  <i>controverted</i> (<span title="antilegomena" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&nu;&tau;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&omicron;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;</span>),
  about which there has always been that difference of opinion which no
  scholar overlooks, however he may decide for himself after balance of
  evidence. Eusebius,<a name="NtA_365" href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a>
  who first (l. 3, c. 25) recorded the distinction&mdash;which was much
  insisted on by the early Protestants&mdash;states the books which are
  questioned as doubtful, but which yet are approved and acknowledged by
  <i>many</i>&mdash;or <i>the many</i>, it is not easy to say which he
  means&mdash;to be the Epistles of James and Jude, the second of Peter and
  the second and third of John. In other places he speaks doubtingly of the
  Epistle to the Hebrews. The Apocalypse he does not even admit into this
  class, for he proceeds as follows&mdash;I use the second edition of the
  English folio translation (1709), to avert suspicion of bias from
  myself:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Among the <i>spurious</i> [<span title="nothoi" class="grk"
  >&nu;&omicron;&theta;&omicron;&iota;</span>] let there be ranked both the
  work entitled the <i>Acts of Paul</i>, and the book called <i>Pastor</i>,
  and the <i>Revelation of Peter</i>: and moreover, that which is called
  the <i>Epistle of Barnabas</i>, and that named the <i>Doctrines of the
  Apostles</i>: and moreover, as I said, the <i>Revelation of John</i> (if
  you think good), which some, as I have said, do reject, but others allow
  of, and admit among those books which are received as unquestionable and
  undoubted."</p>

  <p>Eusebius, though he will not admit the Apocalypse even into the
  <i>controverted</i> list, but gives permission to call it
  <i>spurious</i>, yet qualifies his permission in a manner which almost
  annihilates the distinctive force of <span title="nothos" class="grk"
  >&nu;&omicron;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, and gives the book a claim
  to rank (if you think good, again) in the controverted list. And this is
  the impression received by <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page221"></a>[221]</span>the mind of Lardner, who gives Eusebius
  fully and fairly, but when he sums up, considers his author as admitting
  the Apocalypse into the second list. A stick may easily be found to beat
  the father of ecclesiastical history. There are whole faggots in writers
  as opposite as Baronius and Gibbon, who are perhaps his two most
  celebrated sons. But we can hardly imagine him totally misrepresenting
  the state of opinion of those for whom and among whom he wrote. The usual
  plan, that of making an author take the views of his readers, is more
  easy in his case than in that of any other writer: for, as the riddle
  says, he is You-see-by-us; and to this reading of his name he has often
  been subjected. Dr. Nathaniel Lardner,<a name="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> who, though heterodox in doctrine,
  tries hard to be orthodox as to the Canon, is "sometimes apt to think"
  that the list should be collected and divided as in Eusebius. He would
  have no one of the controverted books to be allowed, by itself, to
  establish any doctrine. Even without going so far, a due use of early
  opinion and long continued discussion would perhaps prevent rational
  people from being induced by those who have the <i>double Vahu</i> to
  place the Apocalypse <i>above</i> the Gospels, which all the Bivahuites
  do in effect, and some are said to have done in express words. But my
  especial purpose is to point out that an easy way of getting rid of 665
  out of 666 of the mystics is to require them to establish the Apocalypse
  before they begin. See if they even know so much as that there is a crowd
  of testimonies for and against, running through the first four centuries,
  which makes this book the most difficult of the whole Canon. Try this
  method, and you will escape beautiful, as the French say. Dean Alford,<a
  name="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> in Vol. IV, p. 8, of
  his New Testament, gives an elaborate handling of this question. He
  concludes by saying that he cannot <!-- Page 222 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>[222]</span>venture to refuse his
  consent to the tradition that the Apostle is the author. This modified
  adherence, or non-nonadherence, pretty well represents the feeling of
  orthodox Protestants, when learning and common sense come together.</p>

  <p>I have often, in former days, had the attempt made to place the
  Apocalypse on my neck as containing prophecies yet unfulfilled. The
  preceding method prevents success; and so does the following. It may
  almost be taken for granted that theological system-fighters do not read
  the New Testament: they hunt it for detached texts; they listen to it in
  church in that state of quiescent nonentity which is called reverent
  attention: but they never read it. When it is brought forward, you must
  pretend to find it necessary to turn to the book itself: you must read
  "The revelation ... to show unto his servants <i>things which must
  shortly come to pass</i>.... Blessed is he that readeth ... <i>for the
  time is at hand</i>." You must then ask your mystic whether things
  deferred for 1800 years were shortly to come to pass, etc.? You must tell
  him that the Greek <span title="en tachei" class="grk">&#x1F10;&nu;
  &tau;&alpha;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;</span>, rendered "shortly," is as strong
  a phrase as the language has to signify <i>soon</i>. The interpreter will
  probably look as if he had never read this opening: the chances are that
  he takes up the book to see whether you have been committing a fraud. He
  will then give you some exquisite evasion: I have heard it pleaded that
  the above was a <i>mere preamble</i>. This word <i>mere</i> is
  all-sufficient: it turns anything into nothing. Perhaps he will say that
  the argument is that of the Papists: if so, tell him that there is no
  Christian sect but bears true witness against some one or more
  absurdities in other sects.</p>

  <p>An anonyme suggests that <span title="en tachei" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&nu; &tau;&alpha;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;</span> may not be "soon,"
  it may be "quickly, without reference to time when:" he continues thus,
  "May not time be 'at hand' when it is ready to come, no matter how long
  delayed?" I now understand what *** and *** meant when they borrowed my
  books and promised to return them quickly, it was "without <!-- Page 223
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>[223]</span>reference to
  time when." As to time at <i>hand</i>&mdash;provided you make a long
  <i>arm</i>&mdash;I admire the quirk, but cannot receive it: the word is
  <span title="engus" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&gamma;&gamma;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, which is a word of
  <i>closeness</i> in time, in place, in reckoning, in kindred, etc.</p>

  <p>Another gentleman is not surprised that Apocalyptic reading leads to a
  doubt of the "canonicity" of the book: it ought not to rest on church
  testimony, but on visible miracle. He offers me, or any reader of the
  <i>Athenæum</i>, the "sight of a miracle to that effect, and within
  forty-eight hours' journey (fare paid)." I seldom travel, and my first
  thought was whether my carpet-bag would be found without a regular hunt:
  but, on reading further, I found that it was only a concordance that
  would be wanted. Forty hours' collection and numerical calculation of
  Greek nouns would make it&mdash;should I happen to agree with the
  writer&mdash;many hundred millions to one that Revelation xiii is
  superhuman. There is but one verse (the fifth) which the writer does not
  see verified. I looked at this verse, and was much startled. The Budget
  began in October 1863: should it last until March 1867&mdash;it is now
  August 1866&mdash;it is clear that I am the first Beast, and my
  paradoxers are the saints whom I persecute.</p>

  <p>[The Budget <i>did</i> terminate in March 1867: I hope the gentleman
  will be satisfied with the resulting interpretation.]</p>

  <p>The same opponent is surprised that I should suppose a thing which
  "comes to pass" must be completed, and cannot contain what is to happen
  1800 years after. All who have any knowledge of English idiom know that a
  thing <i>comes</i> to pass when it happens, and <i>came</i> to pass
  afterwards. But as the original is Greek, we must look at the Greek: it
  is <span title="dei genesthai" class="grk">&delta;&epsilon;&iota;
  &gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span> for "must
  come to pass," and we know that <span title="egeneto" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;</span> is what is
  usually translated "came to pass." No word of more finished completion
  exists in Greek.</p>

  <p>And now for a last round of biter-bit with the Thor-hammerer, of whom,
  as in the other case, I shall take no <!-- Page 224 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>[224]</span>more notice until he
  can contrive to surpass himself, which I doubt his being able to do. He
  informs me that by changing A into <span lang="he" class="heb" title="t"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span> in my name he can make a 666 of
  <i>me</i>; adding, "This is too hard for me, although not so for the
  Lord!" Sheer nonsense! He could just as easily have directed to "Prof. De
  Morg<span lang="he" class="heb" title="t" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span>n" as have assigned me apartment 7<span
  class="scac">A</span> in University College. It would have been seen for
  whom it was intended: and if not, it would still have reached me, for my
  colleagues have for many a year handed all out-of-the-way things over to
  me. There is no 7<span class="scac">A</span>: but 7 is the Museum of
  Materia Medica. I took the only hint which the address gave: I inquired
  for hellebore, but they told me it was not now recognized, that the old
  notion of its value was quite obsolete, and that they had nothing which
  was considered a specific in senary or septenary cases. The great
  platitude is the reference of such a difficulty as writing <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="t" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span> for
  A to the Almighty! Not childish, but fatuous: real childishness is
  delightful. I knew an infant to whom, before he could speak plain, his
  parents had attempted to give notions of the Divine attributes: a wise
  plan, many think. His father had dandled him up-side-down, ending with,
  There now! Papa could not dance on his head! The mannikin made a solemn
  face, and said, <i>But Dod tood</i>! I think the Doctor has rather
  mistaken the way of becoming as a little child, intended in Matt. xviii.
  3: let us hope the will may be taken for the deed.</p>

  <p>Two poets have given images of transition from infancy to manhood:
  Dryden,&mdash;for the Hind is Dryden himself on all fours! and
  Wordsworth, in his own character of broad-nailed, featherless biped:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The priest continues what the nurse began,</p>
      <p>And thus the child imposes on the man."</p>
      <p class="i2hg3">"The child's the father of the man,</p>
      <p class="i2">And I could wish my days to be</p>
      <p class="i2">Bound each to each by natural piety."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>[225]</span></p>

  <p>In Wordsworth's aspiration it is meant that sense and piety should
  grow together: in Dryden's description a combination of Mysticism And
  Bigotry (can this be the <i>double Vahu</i>?), personified as "the
  priest,"&mdash;who always catches it on this score, though the same
  spirit is found in all associations,&mdash;succeeds the boguey-teaching
  of the nurse. Never was the contrast of smile and scowl, of light and
  darkness, better seen than in the two pictures. But an acrostic
  distinction may be drawn. When mysticism predominates over bigotry, we
  have the grotesque picturesque, and the natural order of words gives us
  <i>Mab</i>, an appropriate suggestion. But when bigotry has the upper
  hand, we see <i>Bam</i>, which is just as appropriate; for bigotry nearly
  always deals with facts and logic so as to require the application of at
  least one of the minor words by which dishonesty is signified. I think
  that M is the Doctor's initial, and that Queen Mab tickles him in his
  sleep with the sharp end of a 6.</p>

  <p>(<i>Monday, August 21.</i>) Three weeks having elapsed without notice
  from me of the Doctor, I receive a reminder of his existence, in which I
  find that as I am the Daniel who judges the Magi of Babylon, it is to be
  pointed out that Daniel "bore a certain number, that of a man (beloved),
  Daniel, ch. 10. v. 11, and which you certainly do not." Then, "by Greek
  power," Belteshazzar is made = 666. Here is another awkward imitation of
  the way of a baby child. When you have sported with the tiny creature
  until it runs away offended, by the time you have got into conversation
  again you will find the game is to be renewed: a little head peeps out
  from a hiding-place with "I don't love you." The proper rejoinder is,
  "Very well! then I'll have pussy." But in the case before me there is a
  rule of three sums to do; as baby : Pussy Dr. :: 666 : the answer
  required. I will work it out, if I can.</p>

  <p>The squaring of the circle and the discovery of the Beast are the two
  goals&mdash;and goals also&mdash;of many unbalanced intellects, and of a
  few instances of the better kind. <!-- Page 226 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>[226]</span>I might have said more
  of 666, but I am not deep in its bibliography. A work has come into my
  hands which contains a large number of noted cases: to some of my readers
  it will be a treat to see the collection; and the sight will perhaps be
  of some use to those who have read controversy on the few celebrated
  cases which are of general notoriety. It is written by a learned
  decipherer, a man who really knew the history of the subject, the Rev.
  David Thom,<a name="NtA_368" href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> of Bold
  Street Chapel, Liverpool, who died, I am told, a few years ago.</p>

  <p>Anybody who reads his book will be inclined to parody a criticism
  which was once made on Paley's<a name="NtA_369"
  href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> Evidences&mdash;"Well! if there be
  anything in Christianity, this man is no fool." And, if he should chance
  to remember it, he will be strongly reminded of a sentence in my opening
  chapter,&mdash;"The manner in which a paradoxer will show himself, as to
  sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon
  whether he has or has not made a sufficient knowledge of what has been
  done by others, <i>especially as to the mode of doing it</i>, a
  preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself." And this is reinforced
  by the fact that Mr. Thom, though a scholar, was not conspicuous for
  learning, except in this his great pursuit. He was a paradoxer on other
  points. He reconciled Calvinism and eternal reprobation with Universalism

  Thom<a name="NtA_370" href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> (no relation),
  at or near the same <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page227"></a>[227]</span>time and until recently, of Renshaw Street
  Chapel, Liverpool who was one of the minority in the Liverpool
  controversy when, nearly thirty years ago, <i>three</i> heretical
  Unitarian schooners exchanged shotted sermons with <i>thirteen</i>
  Orthodox ships of the line, and put up their challengers' dander&mdash;an
  American corruption of <i>d&mdash;d anger</i>&mdash;to such an extent, by
  quiet and respectful argument, that those opponents actually addressed a
  printed intercession to the Almighty for the Unitarian triad, as for
  "Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Heretics." So much for the distinction, which
  both gentlemen would thank me for making very clear: I take it quite for
  granted that a guesser at 666 would feel horrified at being taken for a
  Unitarian, and that a Unitarian would feel queerified at being taken for
  a guesser at 666. Mr. David Thom's book is <i>The Number and Names of the
  Apocalyptic Beasts</i>, Part I, 1848, 8vo.: I think the second part was
  never published. I give the Greek and Latin solutions, omitting the
  Hebrew: as usual, all the Greek letters are numeral, but only
  M&nbsp;D&nbsp;C&nbsp;L&nbsp;X&nbsp;V&nbsp;I of the Latin. I do not give either the decipherers or their
  reasons: I have not room for this; nor would I, if I could, bias my
  reader for one rather than another.</p>

  <p>All sects fasten this number on their opponents. It is found in
  <i>Martin Lauter</i>, affirmed to be the true way of writing the name, by
  carrying numbers through the Roman Alphabet. Some Jews, according to Mr.
  Thorn, found it in <span lang="he" class="heb" title="JSHW NTSRJ" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5E9;&#x5D5; &#x5E0;&#x5E6;&#x5E8;&#x5D9;</bdo></span>
  <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>. I find on inquiry that this satire was actually
  put forth by some medieval rabbis, but that it is not idiomatic: it
  represents quite fairly "Jesus Nazarene," but the Hebrew wants an article
  quite as much as the English wants "the."</p>

  <p>Mr. David Thom's own solution hits hard at all sides: he finds a 666
  for both beasts; <span title="hê phrên" class="grk">&#x1F21;
  &phi;&rho;&eta;&nu;</span> (the mind) for the first, and <span
  title="ekklêsiai sarkikai" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&kappa;&kappa;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;&iota;
  &sigma;&alpha;&rho;&kappa;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;</span> (fleshly
  churches) for the second. A solution which embodies all mental philosophy
  in one beast and all dogmatic theology in the other, is very tempting:
  for in these are the two great supports of Antichrist. It will not,
  however, mislead me, who have known the true explanation a long time. The
  three sixes indicate that any two of the three subdivisions, Roman,
  Greek, and Protestant, are, in corruption of Christianity, six of one and
  half a dozen of the other: the distinctions of units, tens, hundreds, are
  nothing but the old way (1 Samuel xviii. 7, and Concordance at
  <i>ten</i>, <i>hundred</i>, <i>thousand</i>) of symbolizing differences
  of number in the subdivisions.</p>

  <p>It may be good to know that, even in speculations on 666, there are
  different degrees of unreason. All the diviners, when they get a
  colleague or an opponent, at once proceed to reckon him up: but some do
  it in play and some in earnest. Mr. David Thom found a young gentleman of
  the name St. Claire busy at the Beast number: he forthwith added the
  letters in <span title="st klaire" class="grk">&sigma;&tau;
  &kappa;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;</span> and found 666: this was
  good fun. But my spiritual tutelary, when he found that he could not make
  a beast of me, except by changing <span lang="he" class="heb" title="A"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;</bdo></span> into <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="T" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span>, solemnly referred the
  difficulty to the Almighty: this was poor earnest. <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>[230]</span></p>

  <p>I am glad I did not notice, in time to insert it in the
  <i>Athenæum</i>, a very remarkable paradoxer brought forward by Mr. Thom,
  his friend Mr. Wapshare<a name="NtA_373"
  href="#Nt_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a>: it is a little too strong for the
  general public. In the <i>Athenæum</i> they would have seen and read it:
  but this book will be avoided by the weaker brethren. It is as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"God, the Elohim, was six days in creating all things, and having made
  <span class="scac">MAN</span> he entered into his rest. He is no more
  seen as a Creator, as Elohim, but as Jehovah, the <i>Lord</i> of the
  Sabbath, and the Spirit of life in <span class="sc">Man</span>, which
  Spirit worketh <i>sin in the flesh</i>; for the Spirit of Love, in all
  flesh, is Lust, or the spirit of a beast, So Rom. vii. And which Spirit
  is <i>crucified</i> in the flesh. He then, as Jehovah&mdash;as the power
  of the Law, <i>in</i> and <i>over</i> all flesh, John viii.
  44&mdash;increases that which he has made as the Elohim, and his power
  shall last for 6 days, or 6 periods of time, computed at a millennium of
  years; and at the end of which six days, he who is the Spirit of all
  flesh shall manifest himself as the Holy Spirit of Almighty Love, and of
  all truth; and so shall the Church have her Sabbath of Rest&mdash;all
  contention being at an end. This is, as well as I may now express it, my
  solution of the mystery in Hebrew, and in Greek, and also in Latin, IHS.
  For he that was lifted up <i>is</i> King of the Jews, and is the Lord of
  all Life, working in us, both to will and to do; as is manifest in the
  Jews&mdash;they slaying him that his blood might be <i>good</i> for the
  healing of the nations, of all people and tongues. As the Father of all
  <i>natural</i> flesh, he is the Spirit of Lust, as in all <i>beasts</i>;
  as the Father, or King of the Jews, he is the Devil, as he himself
  witnesseth in John viii., already referred to. As lifted up, he is
  transformed into the Spirit of Love, a light to the Gentiles, and the
  glory of his people Israel.... For there is but <span
  class="scac">ONE</span> God, <span class="scac">ONE</span> Lord, <span
  class="scac">ONE</span> Spirit, <span class="scac">ONE</span> body, etc.
  and he who was Satan, the Spirit of life in that body, is, in <!-- Page
  231 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[231]</span>Christ
  crucified, seen in the Spirit that is in all, and through all and over
  all, God blessed for ever."</p>

  <p>All this seems well meant, and Mr. Thom prints it as convinced of its
  piety, and "pronounces no opinion." Mystics of all sorts! see what you
  may come to, or what may come to you! I have inserted the above for your
  good.</p>

  <p>There is nothing in this world so steady as some of the paradoxers.
  They are like the spiders who go on spinning after they have web enough
  to catch all the flies in the neighborhood, if the flies would but come.
  They are like the wild bees who go on making honey which they never can
  eat, proving <i>sic vos non vobis</i> to be a physical necessity of their
  own contriving. But nobody robs their hives: no, unlike the bees, they go
  about offering their ware to any who will take it as a gift. I had just
  written the last sentence (Oct. 30, 1866, 8.45 <span
  class="scac">A.M.</span>) when in comes the second note received this
  morning from Dr. Thorn: at 1.30 <span class="scac">P.M.</span> came in a
  third. These arise out of the above account of the Rev. D. Thom,
  published Oct. 27: three notes had arrived before.</p>

  <p>For curiosity I give one day's allowance, supposing these to be all:
  more may arrive before night.</p>

  <p>My account of Mr. Thom and his 666 appeared on October 27: and on the
  29th I received from the editor a copy of Mr. Thom's sermons published in
  1863 (he died Feb. 27, 1862) with best wishes for my health and
  happiness. The editor does not name himself in the book; but he signed
  his name in my copy: and may my circumference never be more than
  3&#x215B; of my diameter if the signature, name and writing both, were
  not that of my <a href="images/bp2circlesquare.png"><img
  src="images/bp2circlesquare.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex"
  alt="circle square" /></a> ing friend Mr. James Smith! And so I have come
  in contact with him on 666 as well as on <span class="grk">&pi;</span>! I
  should have nothing left to live for, had I not happened to hear that he
  has a perpetual motion on hand. I returned thanks and kind regards: and
  Miss Miggs's words&mdash;"Here's forgivenesses of injuries! here's
  amicablenesses!"&mdash;rang in my ears. But I was made slightly
  uncomfortable: how could the war go on after this armistice? Could I ever
  make it understood that the truce only extended to the double Vahu and
  things thereunto relating? It was once held by seafaring men that there
  was no peace with Spaniards beyond the line: I was determined that there
  must be no concord with J.&nbsp;S. inside the circle; that this must be a
  special exception, like Father Huddleston <!-- Page 236 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>[236]</span>and old Grouse in the
  gun-room. I was not long in anxiety; twenty-four hours after the book of
  sermons there came a copy of the threatened exposure&mdash;<i>The British
  Association in Jeopardy, and Professor De Morgan in the Pillory without
  hope of escape</i>. By James Smith, Esq. London and Liverpool, 8vo., 1866
  (pp. 94). This exposure consists of reprints from the <i>Athenæum</i> and
  <i>Correspondent</i>: of things new there is but one. In a short preface
  Mr. J.&nbsp;S. particularly recommends to "<i>read to the end</i>." At the end
  is an appendix of two pages, in type as large as the work; a very
  prominent peroration. It is an article from the <i>Athenæum</i>, left out
  of its place. In the last sentence Mr. J. Smith, who had asked whether
  his character as an honest Geometer and Mathematician was not at stake,
  is warned against the <i>fallacia plurium interrogationum</i>.<a
  name="NtA_377" href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> He is told that there
  is not a more honest what's-his-name in the world: but that as to the
  counter which he calls his character as a mathematician, he is assured
  that it has been staked years ago, and lost. And thus truth has the last
  word. There is no occasion to say much about reprints. One of them is a
  letter [that given above] of August 25, 1865, written by Mr. J.&nbsp;S. to the
  <i>Correspondent</i>. It is one of his quadratures; and the joke is that
  I am made to be the writer: it appears as what Mr. J.&nbsp;S. hopes I shall
  have the sense to write in the <i>Athenæum</i> and forestall him. When I
  saw myself thus quoted&mdash;yes! quoted! double commas, first
  person&mdash;I felt as I suppose did Wm. Wilberforce<a name="NtA_378"
  href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> when he set eyes on the affectionate
  benediction of the potato which waggish comrades had imposed on a raw
  Irish reporter as part of his speech. I felt as Martin<a name="NtA_379"
  href="#Nt_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> of <!-- Page 237 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[237]</span>Galway&mdash;kind
  friend of the poor dumb creatures!&mdash;when he was told that the
  newspapers had put him in Italics. "I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker! I
  appeal to the House! Did I speak in Italics? Do I ever speak in Italics?"
  I appeal to editor and readers, whether I ever squared the circle until a
  week or two ago, when I gave my charitable mode of reconciling the
  discrepant cyclometers.</p>

  <p>The absurdity of the imitation of symbolic reasoning is so lusciously
  rich, that I shall insert it when I make up my final book. Somebody
  mastered Spanish merely to read Don Quixote: it would be worth while to
  learn a little algebra merely to enjoy this <i>a b</i>-istical attack on
  the windmills. The principle is, Prove something in as roundabout a way
  as possible, mention the circle once or twice irrelevantly in the course
  of your proof, and then make an act of Q.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;D. in words at length. The
  following is hardly caricature:&mdash;</p>

  <p>To prove that 2 and 2 make 5. Let <i>a</i> = 2, <i>b</i> = 5: let
  <i>c</i> = 658, the number of the House: let <i>d</i> = 666, the number
  of the Beast. Then of necessity <i>d</i> = <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>c</i>
  + 1; so that 1 is a harmonious and logical quantification of the number
  of which we are to take care. Now, <i>b</i>, the middle of our digital
  system, is, by mathematical and geometrical combination, a mean between 5
  + 1 and 2 + 2. Let 1 be removed to be taken care of, a thing no real
  mathematician can refuse without serious injury to his mathematical and
  geometrical reputation. It follows of necessity that 2 + 2 = 5, <i>quod
  erat demonstrumhorrendum</i>. If Simpkin &amp; Marshall have not, after
  my notice, to account for a gross of copies more than would have gone off
  without me, the world is not worthy of its James Smith!</p>

  <p>The only fault of the above is, that there is more <!-- Page 238
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>[238]</span>connection
  than in the process of Faber Cyclometricus: so much, in fact, that the
  blunders are visible. The utter irrelevance of premises to conclusion
  cannot be exhibited with the requisite obscurity by any one who is able
  to follow reasoning: it is high art displayed in a certain toning down of
  the <i>ægri somnia</i>, which brings them to a certain look of reproach
  to reasoning which I can only burlesque. Mr. J.&nbsp;S. produces something
  which resembles argument much as a chimpanzee in dolor, because balked of
  his dinner, resembles a thinking man at his studies. My humble attempt at
  imitation of him is more like a monkey hanging by his tail from a tree
  and trying to crack a cocoa-nut by his chatter.</p>

  <p>I could forgive Mr. J.&nbsp;S. anything, properly headed. I would allow him
  to prove&mdash;<i>for himself</i>&mdash;that the Quadrature of the Circle
  is the child of a private marriage between the Bull Unigenitus and the
  Pragmatic Sanction, claiming tithe of onions for repeal of the Mortmain
  Act, before the Bishops in Committee under the kitchen table: his mode of
  imitating reason would do this with ease. But when he puts his imitation
  into my mouth, to make me what <i>he</i> calls a "real mathematician," my
  soul rises in epigram against him. I say with the doll's
  dressmaker&mdash;such a job makes me feel like a puppet's tailor
  myself&mdash;"He ought to have a little pepper? just a few grains? I
  think the young man's tricks and manners make a claim upon his friends
  for a little pepper?" De Fauré<a name="NtA_380"

  <p>Joanna Southcott<a name="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a>
  never had a follower who believed in her with more humble piety than Mr.
  James Smith believes in himself. After all that has happened to him, he
  asks me with high confidence to "favor the writer with a proof" that I
  still continue of opinion that "the best of the argument is in my jokes,
  and the best of the joke is in his arguments." I will not so favor him.
  At the very outset I told him in plain English that he has the whiphand
  of all the reasoners in the world, and in plain French that <i>il a perdu
  le droit d'être frappé de l'évidence</i><a name="NtA_385"
  href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a>; I might have said <i>pendu</i>.<a

  href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> The law of Chancery says that he who
  will have equity must do equity: the law of reasoning says that he who
  will have proof must see proof.</p>

  <p>The introduction of things quite irrelevant, by way of reproach, is an
  argument in universal request: and it often happens that the argument so
  produced really tells against the producer. So common is it that we
  forget how boyish it is; but we are strikingly reminded when it actually
  comes from a boy. In a certain police court, certain small boys were
  arraigned for conspiring to hoot an obnoxious individual on his way from
  one of their school exhibitions. This proceeding was necessary, because
  there seemed to be a permanent conspiracy to annoy the gentleman; and the
  <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>[240]</span>masters did not feel able to interfere in
  what took place outside the school. So the boys were arraigned; and their
  friends, as silly in their way as themselves, allowed one of them to make
  the defence, instead of employing counsel; and did not even give them any
  useful hints. The defence was as follows; and any one who does not see
  how richly it sets off the defences of bigger boys in bigger matters has
  much to learn. The innocent conviction that there was answer in the
  latter part is delightful. Of course fine and recognizance followed.</p>

  <p>A&mdash;&mdash; said the boys had received great provocation from
  B&mdash;&mdash;. He was constantly threatening them with a horsewhip
  which he carried in his hand [the boy did not say what had passed to
  induce him to take such a weapon], and he had repeatedly insulted the
  master, which the boys could not stand. B&mdash;&mdash; had in his own
  drawing-room told him (A&mdash;&mdash;) that he had drawn his sword
  against the master and thrown away the scabbard. B&mdash;&mdash; knew
  well that if he came to the college he would catch it, and then he went
  off through a side door&mdash;which was no sign of pluck; and then he
  brought Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash; with him, thinking that her presence would
  protect him.</p>

  <p>My readers may expect a word on Mr. Thom's sermons, after my account
  of his queer doings about 666. He is evidently an honest and devout man,
  much wanting in discrimination. He has a sermon about private
  <i>judgment</i>, in which he halts between the logical and legal meanings
  of the word. He loathes those who apply their private judgment to the
  word of God: here he means those who decide what it <i>ought to be</i>.
  He seems in other places aware that the theological phrase means taking
  right to determine what it <i>is</i>. He uses his own private judgment
  very freely, and is strong in the conclusion that others ought not to use
  theirs except as he tells them how; he leaves all the rest of mankind
  free to think with him. In this he is not original: his fame must rest on
  his senary tripod. <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">JAMES SMITH ONCE MORE.</p>

  <p>Mr. James Smith's procedures are not caricature of reasoning; they are
  caricature of blundering. The old way of proving that 2 = 1 is solemn
  earnest compared with his demonstrations. As follows:<a name="NtA_388"
  href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<table class="nobctr">
<tr><td>Let</td><td align="center"><i>x</i> = 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Then</td><td align="center"><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>And</td><td align="center"><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> - 1 = <i>x</i> - 1</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">Divide both sides by <i>x</i> - 1; then</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2"><i>x</i> + 1 = 1; but <i>x</i> = 1, whence 2 = 1.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>When a man is regularly snubbed, bullied, blown up, walked into, and
  put down, there is usually some reaction in his favor, a kind of
  deostracism, which cannot bear to hear him always called the blunderer. I
  hope it will be so in this case. There is nothing I more desire than to
  see <i>sects</i> of paradoxers. There are fully five thousand adults in
  England who ought to be the followers of some one false quadrature. And I
  have most hope of 3&#x215B;, because I think Mr. James Smith better
  fitted to be the leader of an organized infatuation than any one I know
  of. He wants no pity, and will get none. He has energy, means, good
  humor, strong conviction, character, and popularity in his own circle.
  And, most indispensable point of all, he sticks at nothing;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When my instructor found I did not print an acceptance of what I have
  quoted, he addressed me as follows (<i>Corr.</i>, Sept 23):&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In this life, however, we must do our duty, and, when <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>[242]</span>necessary, use
  the rod, not in a spirit of revenge, but for the benefit of the culprit
  and the good of society. Now, Sir, the opportunity has been thrown in
  your way of slipping out of the pillory without risk of serious injury;
  but, like an obstinate urchin, you have chosen to quarrel with your
  opportunity and remain there, and thus you compel me to deal with you as
  schoolmasters used to do with stupid boys in bygone days&mdash;that is to
  say, you force me to the use of the critic's rod, compel me to put you
  where little Jack Horner sat, and, as a warning to other naughty boys, to
  ornament you with a dunce's cap. The task I set you was a very simple
  one, as I shall make manifest at the proper time."</p>

  <p>In one or more places, as well as this, Mr. Smith shows that he does
  not know the legend of little Jack Horner, whom he imagines to be put in
  the corner as a bad boy. This is curious; for there had been many
  allusions to the story in the journal he was writing in, and the
  Christmas pie had become altered into the Seaforth <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Smith is satisfied at last that&mdash;what between argument and
  punishment he has convinced me. He says (<i>Corr.</i>, Jan. 27, 1866): "I
  tell him without hesitation that he knows the true ratio of diameter to
  circumference as well as I do, and if he be wise he will admit it." I
  should hope I do, and better; but there is no occasion to admit what
  everybody knows.</p>

  <p>I have often wished that we could have a slight glimpse of the
  reception which was given to some of the old cyclometers: but we have
  nothing, except the grave disapprobation of historians. I am resolved to
  give the New Zealander a chance of knowing a little more than this about
  one of them at least; and, by the fortunate entrance into life of the
  <i>Correspondent</i>, I am able to do it. I omit sober mathematical
  answers, of which there were several. The following letter is grave
  earnest:</p>

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;I have watched Mr. James Smith's writings on this subject
  from the first, and I did hope that, as the more <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[243]</span>he departs from truth
  the more easy it must be to refute him, [this by no means always true]
  some of your correspondents would by this time have done so. I own that I
  am unable to detect the fallacy of his argument; and I am quite certain
  that '<span class="grk">&Pi;</span>' is wrong, in No. 23, where he
  declares that Mr. Smith is 'ignorant of the very elements of mathematical
  truth.' I have observed an immense amount of geometrical reasoning on his
  part, and I cannot see that it is either fair or honest to deny this,
  which may be regarded as the 'elements' of mathematical truth. Would it
  not be better for '<span class="grk">&Pi;</span>' to answer Mr. Smith, to
  refute his arguments, to point out their fallacies, and to save learners
  from error, than to plunge into gross insult and unmanly abuse? Would it
  not be well, also, that Professor De Morgan should favour us with a
  little reasoning?</p>

  <p>"I have hitherto seen no attempt to overthrow Mr. Smith's arguments; I
  trust that this will not continue, since the subject is one of immense
  importance to science in general, especially to nautical science, and all
  that thereto belongs.</p>

<p class="cenhead">Yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">A Captain, R.N.</span>"</p>

  <p>On looking at this hom&oelig;opathic treatment of the 3&#x215B;
  quadrature&mdash;remember, hom&oelig;opathic, <i>similia similibus</i>,<a
  name="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> not
  infinitesimal&mdash;and at the imputation thrown upon it, I asked myself,
  what <i>is</i> vulgarity? No two agree, except in this, that every one
  sees vulgarity in what is directed against himself. Mark the world, and
  see if anything be so common as the description of the other side's
  remarks as "vulgar attempt at wit." "I suppose you think that very
  witty:" the answer is "No my friend! your remark shows that you feel it
  as wit, so that the purpose is answered; I keep my razor for something
  else than cutting blocks;" I am inclined to think that "out of place" is
  a necessary attribute of true vulgarity. And further, it is to be noticed
  that nothing is <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>[244]</span>unproducible&mdash;<i>salvo pudore</i><a
  name="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a>&mdash;which has
  classical authority, modern or ancient, in its favor. "He is a vulgar
  fellow; I asked him what he was upon, and what do you think he answered,
  My legs!"&mdash;"Well, and has he not justification? what do you find in
  Terence? <i>Quid agitur? Statur.</i>"<a name="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> I do not even blench from my
  principle where I find that it brings what is called "taking a sight"
  within permissible forms of expression: Rabelais not only establishes its
  antiquity, but makes it English. Our old translation<a name="NtA_393"
  href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> has it thus (book 2. ch. 19):</p>

  <p>"Then made the Englishman this sign. His left hand, all open, he
  lifted up into the air, then instantly shut into his fist the four
  fingers thereof; and his thumb extended at length he placed upon the tip
  of his nose. Presently after he lifted up his right hand all open and
  abased and bent it downwards, putting the thumb thereof in the very place
  where the little finger of the left hand did close in the fist, and the
  four right hand fingers he softly moved in the air. Then contrarily he
  did with the right hand what he had done with the left, and with the left
  what he had done with the right."</p>

  <p>An impressive sight! The making of a fist of the left hand is a great
  addition of power, and should be followed in modern practice. The gentle
  sullation of the front fingers, with the clenched fist behind them, says
  as plainly as possible, Put <i>suaviter in modo</i> in the van, but don't
  forget to have <i>fortiter in re</i><a name="NtA_394"

  <p>"<i>April 23.</i>&mdash;Sir. Very sincerely yours. More letters to
  clergyman; you may as well knock your head against a stone wall to

  <p>"<i>May 6.</i>&mdash;My dear Sir. Very sincerely yours. All to myself,
  and nothing to note.</p>

  <p>"<i>July 2.</i>&mdash;No more in this interval. All that precedes is a
  desperate attempt to induce me to continue my descriptions: notoriety at
  any price."</p>

  <p>I dare say the matter is finished: the record of so marked an instance
  of self-delusion will be useful.</p>

  <p>I append to the foregoing a letter from Dr. Whewell<a name="NtA_395"
  href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> to Mr. James Smith. The Master of
  Trinity was conspicuous as a rough customer, an intellectual bully, an
  overbearing disputant: the character was as well established as that of
  Sam Johnson. But there was a marked difference. It was said of Johnson
  that if his pistol missed fire, he would knock you down with the butt end
  of it: but Whewell, in like case, always acknowledged the miss, and
  loaded again or not, as the case might be. He reminded me of Dennis
  Brulgruddery, who says to Dan, Pacify me with a good reason, and you'll
  find me a dutiful master. I knew him from the time when he was my teacher
  at Cambridge, more than forty years. As a teacher, he was anything but
  dictatorial, and he was perfectly accessible to proposal of objections.
  He came in contact with me in his slashing way twice in our after joint
  lives, and on both occasions he acknowledged himself overcome, by that
  change of manner, and apologetic mode of continuance, which I had seen
  him employ towards others under like circumstances.</p>

  <p>I had expressed my wish to have a <i>thermometer of probability</i>,
  with impossibility at one end, as 2 and 2 make 5, and necessity at the
  other, as 2 and 2 make 4, and a graduated rise of examples between them.
  Down came a blow: "What! put necessary and contingent propositions
  together! It's absurd!" I pointed out that the two kinds of necessity are
  but such extremes of probability as 0 and &infin; are of number, and
  illustrated by an urn with 1 white and <i>n</i> black <!-- Page 247
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[247]</span>balls,
  <i>n</i> increasing without limit. It was frankly seen, and the point
  yielded; a large company was present.</p>

  <p>Again, in a large party, after dinner, and politics being the subject,
  I was proceeding, in discussion with Mr. Whewell, with "I
  think"...&mdash;"Ugh! <i>you</i> think!" was the answer. I repeated my
  phrase, and gave as a reason the words which Lord Grey<a name="NtA_396"
  href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> had used in the House of Lords the
  night before (the celebrated advice to the Bishops to set their houses in
  order). He had not heard of this, and his manner changed in an instant:
  he was the rational discutient all the rest of the evening, having
  previously been nothing but a disputant with all the distinctions
  strongly marked.</p>

  <p>I have said that Whewell was gentle with his pupils; it was the same
  with all who wanted teaching: it was only on an armed enemy that he drew
  his weapon. The letter which he wrote to Mr. J. Smith is an instance: and
  as it applies with perfect fidelity to the efforts of unreasoning above
  described, I give it here. Mr. James Smith is skilfully exposed, and felt
  it; as is proved by "putting the writer in the stocks."</p>

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;I have received your explanation of your proposition that
  the circumference of the circle is to its diameter as 25 to 8. I am
  afraid I shall disappoint you by saying that I see no force in your
  proof: and I should hope that you will see that there is no force in it
  if you consider this: In the whole course of the proof, though the word
  cycle occurs, there is no property of the circle employed. You may do
  this: you may put the word <i>hexagon</i> or <i>dodecagon</i>, or any
  other word describing a polygon in the place of <i>Circle</i> in your
  proof, and the proof would be just as good as before. Does not this
  satisfy you that you cannot have proved a property of that special
  figure&mdash;a circle? <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>"Or you may do this: calculate the side of a polygon of 24 sides
  inscribed in a circle. I think you are a Mathematician enough to do this.
  You will find that if the radius of the circle be one, the side of this
  polygon is .264 etc. Now, the arc which this side subtends is according
  to your proposition 3.125/12 = .2604, and therefore the chord is greater
  than its arc, which you will allow is impossible.</p>

<p class="cenhead">AN M.P.'S ARITHMETIC.</p>

  <p>In the debate of May, 1866, on Electoral Qualifications, a question
  arose about arithmetical capability. Mr. Gladstone asked how many members
  of the House could divide 1330<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> by
  2<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Six hundred and fifty-eight, answered
  one member; the thing cannot be done, answered another. There is an old
  paradox to which this relates: it arises out of the ignorance of the
  distinction between abstract and concrete arithmetic. <i>Magnitude</i>
  may be divided by <i>magnitude</i>; and the answer is number: how often
  does 12<i>d.</i> contain 4<i>d.</i>; answer three times. <i>Magnitude</i>
  may be divided by <i>number</i>, and the answer is <i>magnitude</i>:
  12<i>d.</i> is divided in four equal parts, what is each part? Answer
  three <i>pence</i>. The honorable objector, whose name I suppress,
  trusting that he has mended his ways, gave the following utterance:</p>

  <p>"With regard to the division sum, it was quite possible to divide by a
  sum, but not by money. How could any one divide money by 2<i>l.</i>
  16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>? (Laughter.) The question might be asked, 'How
  many times 2<i>s.</i> will go into 1<i>l.</i>?' but that was not dividing
  by money; it was simply dividing 20 by 2. He might be asked, 'How many
  times will 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> go into a pound?' but it was only
  required to divide 240 by 80. If the right hon. gentleman were to ask the
  hon. <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>[249]</span>member for Brighton (Professor Fawcett),<a
  name="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> or any other
  authority, he would receive the same answer&mdash;viz., that it was
  possible to divide by a sum, but not by money. (Hear.)"</p>

  <p>I shall leave all comment for the second edition, if I publish one.<a
  name="NtA_398" href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> I shall be sure to
  have something to laugh at. Anything said from a respectable quarter, or
  supposed to be said, is sure to find defenders. Sam Johnson, a sound
  arithmetician, comparing himself, and what he alone had done in three
  years, with forty French Academicians and their forty years, said it
  proved that an Englishman is to a Frenchman as 40 × 40 to 3, or as 1600
  to 3. Boswell, who was no great hand at arithmetic, made him say that an
  Englishman is to a Frenchman as 3 to 1600. When I pointed this out, the
  supposed Johnson was defended through thick and thin in <i>Notes and
  Queries</i>.</p>

  <p>I am now curious to see whether the following will find a palliator.
  It is from "Tristram Shandy," book V. chapter 3. There are two curious
  idioms, "for for" and "half in half"; but these have nothing to do with
  my point:</p>

  <p>"A blessing which tied up my father's tongue, and a misfortune which
  set it loose with a good grace, were pretty equal: sometimes, indeed, the
  misfortune was the better of the two; for, for instance, where the
  pleasure of harangue was as <i>ten</i>, and the pain of the misfortune
  but as <i>five</i>, my father gained half in half; and consequently was
  as well again off as if it had never befallen him."</p>

  <p>This is a jolly confusion of ideas; and wants nothing but a defender
  to make it perfect. A person who invests five <!-- Page 250 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>[250]</span>with a return of ten,
  and one who loses five with one hand and gains ten with the other, both
  leave off five richer than they began, no doubt. The first gains "half in
  half," more properly "half <i>on</i> half," that is, of the return, 10,
  the second 5 is gain upon the first 5 invested. "Half <i>in</i> half" is
  a queer way of saying cent. per cent. If the 5<i>l.</i> invested be all
  the man had in the world, he comes out, after the gain, twice as well off
  as he began, with reference to his whole fortune. But it is very odd to
  say that balance of 5<i>l.</i> gain is <i>twice</i> as good as if nothing
  had befallen, either loss or gain. A mathematician thinks 5 an infinite
  number of times as great as 0. The whole confusion is not so apparent
  when money is in question: for money is money whether gained or lost. But
  though pleasure and pain stand to one another in the same algebraical
  relation as money gained and lost, yet there is more than algebra can
  take account of in the difference.</p>

  <p>Next, Ri. Milward<a name="NtA_399" href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a>
  (Richard, no doubt, but it cannot be proved) who published Selden's<a
  name="NtA_400" href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> Table Talk, which he
  had collected while serving as amanuensis, makes Selden say, "A subsidy
  was counted the fifth part of a man's estate; and so fifty subsidies is
  five and forty times more than a man is worth." For <i>times</i> read
  <i>subsidies</i>, which seems part of the confusion, and there remains
  the making all the subsidies equal to the first, though the whole of
  which they are to be the fifths is perpetually diminished.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, there is the confusion of the great misomath <!-- Page 251
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>[251]</span>of our own
  day, who discovered two quantities which he avers to be identically the
  same, but the greater the one the less the other. He had a truth in his
  mind, which his notions of quantity were inadequate to clothe in
  language. This erroneous phraseology has not found a defender; and I am
  almost inclined to say, with Falstaff, The poor abuses of the time want
  countenance.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ERRONEOUS ARITHMETICAL NOTIONS.</p>

  <p>"Shallow numerists," as Cocker<a name="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> is made to call them, have long been
  at work upon the question how to <i>multiply</i> money by money. It is, I
  have observed, a very common way of amusing the tedium of a sea voyage: I
  have had more than one bet referred to me. Because an oblong of five
  inches by four inches contains 5 × 4 or 20 <i>square</i> inches, people
  say that five inches multiplied by four inches <i>is</i> twenty
  <i>square</i> inches: and, thinking that they have multiplied length by
  length, they stare when they are told that money cannot be multiplied by
  money. One of my betters made it an argument for the thing being
  impossible, that there is no <i>square money</i>: what could I do but
  suggest that postage-stamps should be made legal tender. Multiplication
  must be <i>repetition</i>: the repeating process must be indicated by
  <i>number</i> of times. I once had difficulty in persuading another of my
  betters that if you repeat five shillings as often as there are hairs in
  a horse's tail, you do not <i>multiply five shillings by a
  horsetail</i>.<a name="NtA_402" href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I am very sorry to say that these wrong notions have found
  support&mdash;I think they do so no longer&mdash;in the University of
  Cambridge. In 1856 or 1857, an examiner was displaced by a vote of the
  Senate. The pretext was that he was too severe an examiner: but it was
  well known that <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>[252]</span>great dissatisfaction had been expressed,
  far and wide through the Colleges, at an absurd question which he had
  given. He actually proposed such a fraction as</p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>
6<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i><br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br />17<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></td><td>.
</td></tr></table>

  <p>As common sense gained a hearing very soon, there is no occasion to
  say more. In 1858, it was proposed at a college examination, to divide
  22557 days, 20 hours, 20 minutes, 48 seconds, by 57 minutes, 12 seconds,
  and also to explain the fraction</p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>
32<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br />62<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></td><td>.
</td></tr></table>

  <p>All paradoxy, in matters of demonstration, arises out of muddle about
  first principles. Who can say how much of it is to be laid at the door of
  the University of Cambridge, for not taking care of the elements of
  arithmetical thought?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON LITERARY BARGAINS.</p>

  <p>The phenomena of the two ends of society, when brought together, give
  interesting comparisons: I mean the early beginnings of thought and
  literature, and our own high and finished state, as we think it. There is
  one very remarkable point. In the early day, the letter was matter of the
  closest adherence, and implied meanings were not admitted.</p>

  <p>The blessing of Isaac meant for Esau, went to false Jacob, in spite of
  the imposition; and the writer of Genesis seems to intend to give the
  notion that Isaac had no power to pronounce it null and void. And
  "Jacob's policy, whereby he became rich"&mdash;as the chapter-heading
  puts it&mdash;in speckled and spotted stock, is not considered as a
  violation of the agreement, which contemplated natural proportions. In
  <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>[253]</span>the story of Lycurgus the lawgiver is held
  to have behaved fairly when he bound the Spartans to obey his laws until
  he returned&mdash;intimating a short absence&mdash;he intending never to
  return. And Vishnoo, when he asked the usurper for three steps of
  territory as a dwarf, and then enlarged himself until he could bring
  heaven and earth under the bargain, was thought clever, certainly, but
  quite fair.</p>

  <p>There is nothing of this kind recognized in our day: so far good. But
  there is a bad contrary: the age is apt, in interpretation, to upset the
  letter in favor of the view&mdash;very often the after thought&mdash;of
  one side only. The case of John Palmer,<a name="NtA_403"
  href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> the improver of the mail coach
  system, is smothered. He was to have an office and a salary, and 2½ per
  cent for life on the increased <i>revenue</i> of the Post-Office. His
  rights turned out so large, that Government would not pay them. For
  misconduct, real or pretended, they turned him out of his <i>office</i>:
  but his bargain as to the percentage had nothing to do with his future
  conduct; it was payment for his <i>plan</i>. I know nothing, except from
  the debates of 1808 in the two Houses: if any one can redeem the credit
  of the nation, the field is open. When I was young, the old stagers spoke
  of this transaction sparingly, and dismissed it speedily.</p>

  <p>The government did not choose to remember what private persons must
  remember, and are made to remember, if needful. When Dr. Lardner<a
  name="NtA_404" href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> made his bargain with
  the <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page254"></a>[254]</span>publishers for the <i>Cabinet
  Cyclopædia</i> he proposed that he, as editor, should have a certain sum
  for every hundred sold above a certain number: the publishers, who did
  not think there was any chance of reaching the turning sale of this
  stipulation, readily consented. But it turned out that Dr. Lardner saw
  further than they: the returns under this stipulation gave him a very
  handsome addition to his other receipts. The publishers stared; but they
  paid. They had no idea of standing out that the amount was too much for
  an editor; they knew that, though the editor had a percentage, they had
  all the rest; and they would not have felt aggrieved if he had received
  ten times as much. But governments, which cannot be brought to book
  before a sworn jury, are ruled only by public opinion. John Palmer's day
  was also the day of Thomas Fyshe Palmer,<a name="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> and the governments, in their
  prosecutions for sedition, knew that these would have a reflex action
  upon the minds of all who wrote about public affairs.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">DECLARATION OF BELIEF</p>

  <p>1864-65.&mdash;It often happens that persons combine to maintain and
  enforce an opinion; but it is, in our state of society, a paradox to
  unite for the sole purpose of blaming the opposite side. To invite
  educated men to do this, and above all, men of learning or science, is
  the next paradoxical thing of all. But this was done by a small
  combination in 1864. They got together and drew up a <i>declaration</i>,
  to be signed by "students of the natural sciences," who were to express
  their "sincere regret that researches into <!-- Page 255 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>[255]</span>scientific truth are
  perverted by some in our own times into occasion for casting doubt upon
  the truth and authenticity of the Holy Scriptures." In words of ambiguous
  sophistry, they proceeded to request, in effect, that people would be
  pleased to adopt the views of churches as to the <i>complete</i>
  inspiration of all the canonical books. The great question whether the
  Word of God is <i>in</i> the Bible, or whether the Word of God is
  <i>all</i> the Bible, was quietly taken for granted in favor of the
  second view; to the end that men of science might be induced to blame
  those who took the first view. The first public attention was drawn to
  the subject by Sir John Herschel,<a name="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> who in refusing to sign the writ sent
  to him, administered a rebuke in the <i>Athenæum</i>, which would have
  opened most eyes to see that the case was hopeless. The words of a man
  whose <i>suaviter in modo</i> makes his <i>fortiter in re</i><a
  name="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> cut blocks with a
  razor are worth preserving:</p>

  <p>"I consider the act of calling upon me publicly to avow or disavow, to
  approve or disapprove, in writing, any religious doctrine or statement,
  however carefully or cautiously drawn up (in other words, to append my
  name to a religious manifesto) to be an infringement of that social
  forbearance which guards the freedom of religious opinion in this country
  with especial sanctity.... I consider this movement simply mischievous,
  having a direct tendency (by putting forward a new Shibboleth, a new
  verbal test of religious partisanship) to add a fresh element of discord
  to the already too discordant relations of the Christian world.... But no
  nicety of wording, no artifice of human language, will suffice to
  discriminate the hundredth part of the shades of meaning in which the
  most world-wide differences of thought on such subjects may be involved;
  or prevent the most gentle worded and apparently justifiable expression
  of regret, so embodied, from grating on the <!-- Page 256 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>[256]</span>feelings of thousands
  of estimable and well-intentioned men with all the harshness of
  controversial hostility."</p>

  <p>Other doses were administered by Sir J. Bowring,<a name="NtA_408"
  href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> Sir W. Rowan Hamilton,<a
  name="NtA_409" href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> and myself. The signed
  declaration was promised for Christmas, 1864: but nothing presentable was
  then ready; and it was near Midsummer, 1865, before it was published.
  Persons often incautiously put their names without seeing the
  <i>character</i> of a document, because they coincide in its
  <i>opinions</i>. In this way, probably, fifteen respectable names were
  procured before printing; and these, when committed, were hawked as part
  of an application to "solicit the favor" of other signatures. It is
  likely enough no one of the fifteen saw that the declaration was, not
  <i>maintenance</i> of their own opinion, but <i>regret</i> (a civil word
  for <i>blame</i>) that others should <i>think differently</i>.</p>

  <p>When the list appeared, there were no fewer than 716 names! But
  analysis showed that this roll was not a specimen of the mature science
  of the country. The collection was very miscellaneous: 38 were designated
  as "students of the College of Chemistry," meaning young men who attended
  lectures in that college. But as all the Royal Society had been applied
  to, a test results as follows. Of Fellows of the Royal Society, 600 in
  number, 62 gave their signatures; of writers in the <i>Philosophical
  Transactions</i>, 166 in number, 19 gave their signatures. Roughly
  speaking, then, only one out of ten could be got to express
  disapprobation of the free comparison of the results of science with the
  statements of the canonical books. And I am satisfied that many of these
  thought they were signing only a declaration of difference of opinion,
  not of blame for that difference. The number of persons is not small who,
  when it comes to signing printed documents, would put their names to a
  declaration that the coffee-pot ought to be taken down-stairs, meaning
  that the teapot ought to be brought <!-- Page 257 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>[257]</span>up-stairs. And many of
  them would defend it. Some would say that the two things are not
  contradictory; which, with a snort or two of contempt, would be very
  effective. Others would, in the candid and quiet tone, point out that it
  is all one, because coffee is usually taken before tea, and it keeps the
  table clear to send away the coffee-pot before the teapot is brought
  up.</p>

  <p>The original signatures were decently interred in the Bodleian
  Library: and the advocates of scattering indefinite blame for indefinite
  sins of opinion among indefinite persons are, I understand, divided in
  opinion about the time at which the next attempt shall be made upon men
  of scientific studies: some are for the Greek Calends, and others for the
  Roman Olympiads. But, with their usual love of indefiniteness, they have
  determined that the choice shall be argued upon the basis that which
  comes first cannot be settled, and is of no consequence.</p>

  <p>I give the declaration entire, as a curiosity: and parallel with it I
  give a substitute which was proposed in the <i>Athenæum</i>, as worthy to
  be signed both by students of theology, and by students of science,
  especially in past time. When a new attempt is made, it will be worth
  while to look at both:</p>

  <p>The distinctness of the fallacies is creditable to the composers, and
  shows that scientific habits tend to clearness, even to sophistry.
  Nowhere does it so plainly stand out that the <i>Written Word</i> means
  the sense in which the accuser takes it, while the sense of the other
  side is <i>their interpretation</i>. The infallible church on one side,
  arrayed against heretical pravity on the other, is seen in all subjects
  in which men differ. At school there were various games in which one or
  another advantage was the right of those who first called for it. In

  Secondly, I do <i>not</i> regret that others should differ from me, think
  what I may: those others are as good as I, and as well able to think, and
  as much entitled to their conclusions. Thirdly, even if I did regret, I

  attempts to repress freedom of inquiry, nor of the loathing with which I
  recoil from the proposal to be art and part. They have asked me to give a
  public opinion upon a certain point. It is true that they have had the
  kindness to tender both the opinion they wish me to form, and the shape
  in which they would have it appear: I will let them draw me out, but I
  will not let them take me in. If they will put an asterisk to my name,
  and this letter to the asterisk, they are welcome to my signature. As I
  do not expect them to relish this proposal, I will not solicit the favor
  of its adoption. But they have given a right to think, for they have
  asked me to think; to publish, for they have asked me to allow them to
  publish; to blame them, for they have asked me to blame their betters.
  Should they venture to find fault because my direction of disapproval,

<p class="cenhead">THE FLY-LEAF PARADOX.</p>

  <p>The paradox being the proposition of something which runs counter to
  what would generally be thought likely, may present itself in many ways.
  There is a <i>fly-leaf paradox</i>, which puzzled me for many years,
  until I found a probable solution. I frequently saw, in the blank leaves
  of old books, learned books, Bibles of a time when a Bible was very
  costly, etc., the name of an owner who, by the handwriting and spelling,
  must have been an illiterate person or a child, followed by the date of
  the book itself. Accordingly, this uneducated person or young child
  seemed to be the first owner, which in many cases was not credible.
  Looking one day at a Barker's<a name="NtA_418"
  href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> Bible of 1599, I saw an <!-- Page 265
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>[265]</span>inscription in
  a child's writing, which certainly belonged to a much later date. It was
  "Martha Taylor, her book, giuen me by Granny Scott to keep for her sake."
  With this the usual verses, followed by 1599, the date of the book. But
  it so chanced that the blank page opposite the title, on which the above
  was written, was a verso of the last leaf of a prayer book, which had
  been bound before the Bible; and on the recto of this leaf was a
  colophon, with the date 1632. It struck me immediately that uneducated
  persons and children, having seen dates written under names, and not
  being quite up in chronology, did frequently finish off with the date of
  the book, which stared them in the face.</p>

  <p>Always write in your books. You may be a silly person&mdash;for though
  your reading my book is rather a contrary presumption, yet it is not
  conclusive&mdash;and your observations may be silly or irrelevant, but
  you cannot tell what use they may be of long after you are gone where
  Budgeteers cease from troubling.</p>

  <p>I picked up the following book, printed by J. Franklin<a
  name="NtA_419" href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> at Boston, during the
  period in which his younger brother Benjamin was his apprentice. And as
  Benjamin was apprenticed very early, and is recorded as having learned
  the mechanical art very rapidly, there is some presumption that part of
  it may be his work, though he was but thirteen at the time. As this set
  of editions of Hodder<a name="NtA_420"
  href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> (by <!-- Page 266 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>[266]</span>Mose<a name="NtA_421"
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a>) is not mentioned, to my knowledge, I
  give the title in full:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hodder's Arithmetick: or that necessary art made most easy: Being
  explained in a way familiar to the capacity of any that desire to learn
  it in a little time. By James Hodder, Writing-master. The Five and
  twentieth edition, revised, augmented, and above a thousand faults
  amended, by Henry Mose, late servant and successor to the author. Boston:
  printed by J. Franklin, for S. Phillips, N. Buttolph, B. Elliot, D.
  Henchman, G. Phillips, J. Elliot, and E. Negus, booksellers in Boston,
  and sold at their shops. 1719."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The book is a very small octavo, the type and execution are
  creditable, the woodcut at the beginning is clumsy. It is a perfect copy,
  page for page, of the English editions of Mose's Hodder, of which the one
  called seventeenth is of London, 1690. There is not a syllable to show
  that the edition above described might not be of Boston in England.
  Presumptions, but not very strong ones, might be derived from the name of
  <i>Franklin</i>, and from the large number of booksellers who combined in
  the undertaking. It chanced, however, that a former owner had made the
  following note in my copy:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wednessday, July y<sup>e</sup> 14, 1796, att ten in y<sup>e</sup>
  forenoon we sail<sup>d</sup> from Boston, came too twice, once in King
  Rode, and once in y<sup>e</sup> Narrows. Sail<sup>d</sup> by
  y<sup>e</sup> lighthouse in y<sup>e</sup> even<sup>g</sup>."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[267]</span></p>

  <p>No ordinary map would decide these points: so I had to apply to my
  friend Sir Francis Beaufort,<a name="NtA_422"
  href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> and the charts at the Admiralty
  decided immediately for Massachusetts.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">PARADOXES OF ORTHOGRAPHY AND COMPUTATION.</p>

  <p>The French are able paradoxers in their spelling of foreign names. The
  Abbé Sabatier de Castres,<a name="NtA_423"
  href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> in 1772, gives an account of an
  imaginary dialogue between Swif, Adisson, Otwai, and Bolingbrocke. I had
  hoped that this was a thing of former days, like the literal roasting of
  heretics; but the charity which hopeth all things must hope for
  disappointments. Looking at a recent work on the history of the popes, I
  found referred to, in the matter of Urban VIII<a name="NtA_424"
  href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> and Galileo, references to the works
  of two Englishmen, the Rev. Win Worewel and the Rev. Raden Powen. [Wm.
  Whewell and Baden Powell].<a name="NtA_425"
  href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I must not forget the "moderate computation" paradox. This is the way
  by which large figures are usually obtained. Anything surprisingly great
  is got by the "lowest computation," anything as surprisingly small by the
  "utmost computation"; and these are the two great subdivisions of
  "moderate computation." In this way we learn that 70,000 persons were
  executed in one reign, and 150,000 persons <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>[268]</span>burned for witchcraft
  in one century. Sometimes this computation is very close. By a card
  before me it appears that all the Christians, including those dispersed
  in heathen countries, those of Great Britain and Ireland excepted, are
  198,728,000 people, and pay their clergy 8,852,000<i>l.</i> But 6,400,000
  people pay the clergy of the Anglo-Irish Establishment
  8,896,000<i>l.</i>; and 14,600,000 of other denominations pay
  1,024,000<i>l.</i> When I read moderate computations, I always think of
  Voltaire and the "mémoires du fameux évêque de Chiapa, par lesquels il
  paraît qu'il avait égorgé, ou brulé, ou noyé dix millions d'infidèles en
  Amérique pour les convertir. Je crus que cet évêque exaggérait; mais
  quand on réduisait ces sacrifices à cinq millions de victimes, cela
  serait encore admirable."<a name="NtA_426"
  href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CENTRIFUGAL FORCE.</p>

  <p>My Budget has been arranged by authors. This is the only plan, for
  much of the remark is personal: the peculiarities of the paradoxer are a
  large part of the interest of the paradox. As to subject-matter, there
  are points which stand strongly out; the quadrature of the circle, for
  instance. But there are others which cannot be drawn out so as to be
  conspicuous in a review of writers: as one instance, I may take the
  <i>centrifugal force</i>.</p>

  <p>When I was about nine years old I was taken to hear a course of
  lectures, given by an itinerant lecturer in a country town, to get as
  much as I could of the second half of a good, sound, philosophical
  omniscience. The first half (and sometimes more) comes by nature. To this
  end I smelt chemicals, learned that they were different kinds of
  <i>gin</i>, saw young wags try to kiss the girls under the excuse of what
  was called <i>laughing gas</i>&mdash;which I was sure <!-- Page 269
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>[269]</span>was not to
  blame for more than five per cent of the requisite assurance&mdash;and so
  forth. This was all well so far as it went; but there was also the
  excessive notion of creative power exhibited in the millions of miles of
  the solar system, of which power I wondered they did not give a still
  grander idea by expressing the distances in inches. But even this was
  nothing to the ingenious contrivance of the centrifugal force. "You have
  heard what I have said of the wonderful centripetal force, by which
  Divine Wisdom has retained the planets in their orbits round the Sun.
  But, ladies and gentlemen, it must be clear to you that if there were no
  other force in action, this centripetal force would draw our earth and
  the other planets into the Sun, and universal ruin would ensue. To
  prevent such a catastrophe, the same wisdom has implanted a centrifugal
  force of the same amount, and directly opposite," etc. I had never heard
  of Alfonso X of Castile,<a name="NtA_427"
  href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> but I ventured to think that if
  Divine Wisdom had just let the planets alone it would come to the same
  thing, with equal and opposite troubles saved. The paradoxers deal
  largely in speculation conducted upon the above explanation. They provide
  external agents for what they call the centrifugal force. Some make the
  sun's rays keep the planets off, without a thought about what would
  become of our poor eyes if the <i>push</i> of the light which falls on
  the earth were a counterpoise to all its gravitation. The true
  explanation cannot be given here, for want of room.</p>

<p class="cenhead">CAMBRIDGE POETS.</p>

  <p>Sometimes a person who has a point to carry will assert a singular
  fact or prediction for the sake of his point; and <!-- Page 270 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[270]</span>this paradox has almost
  obtained the sole use of the name. Persons who have reputation to care
  for should beware how they adopt this plan, which now and then eventuates
  a spanker, as the American editor said. Lord Byron, in "English Bards,
  etc." (1809), ridiculing Cambridge poetry, wrote as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But where fair Isis rolls her purer wave,</p>
      <p>The partial muse delighted loves to lave;</p>
      <p>On her green banks a greener wreath she wove,</p>
      <p>To crown the bards that haunt her classic grove;</p>
      <p>Where Richards<a name="NtA_428" href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> wakes a genuine poet's fires,</p>
      <p>And modern Britons glory in their sires."<a name="NtA_429" href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There is some account of the Rev. Geo. Richards, Fellow of Oriel and
  Vicar of Bampton, (M.A. in 1791) in the <i>Living Authors</i> by
  Watkins<a name="NtA_430" href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> and
  Shoberl<a name="NtA_431" href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> (1816). In
  Rivers's <i>Living Authors</i>, of 1798, which is best fitted for
  citation, as being published before Lord Byron wrote, he is spoken of in
  high terms. The <i>Aboriginal Britons</i> was an Oxford (special) prize
  poem, of 1791. Charles Lamb mentions Richards as his school-fellow at
  Christ's Hospital, "author of the <i>Aboriginal Britons</i>, the most
  spirited of the Oxford Prize Poems: a pale, studious Grecian."</p>

  <p>As I never heard of Richards as a poet,<a name="NtA_432"
  href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> I conclude that his fame is defunct,
  except in what may prove to be a very ambiguous kind of immortality,
  conferred by Lord Byron. The awkwardness of a case which time has broken
  down <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>[271]</span>is increased by the eulogist himself
  adding so powerful a name to the list of Cambridge poets, that his
  college has placed his statue in the library, more conspicuously than
  that of Newton in the chapel; and this although the greatness of poetic
  fame had some serious drawbacks in the moral character of some of his
  writings. And it will be found on inquiry that Byron, to get his instance
  against Cambridge, had to go back eighteen years, passing over seven
  intermediate productions, of which he had either never heard, or which he
  would not cite as waking a genuine poet's fires.</p>

  <p>The conclusion seems to be that the <i>Aboriginal Britons</i> is a
  remarkable youthful production, not equalled by subsequent efforts.</p>

  <p>To enhance the position in which the satirist placed himself, two
  things should be remembered. First, the glowing and justifiable terms in
  which Byron had spoken,&mdash;a hundred and odd lines before he found it
  convenient to say no Cambridge poet could compare with Richards,&mdash;of
  a Cambridge poet who died only three years before Byron wrote, and
  produced greatly admired works while actually studying in the University.
  The fame of Kirke White<a name="NtA_433"
  href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> still lives; and future literary
  critics may perhaps compare his writings and those of Richards, simply by
  reason of the curious relation in which they are here placed alongside of
  each other. And it is much to Byron's credit that, in speaking of the
  deceased Cambridge poet, he forgot his own argument and its exigencies,
  and proved himself only a paradoxer <i>pro re nata</i>.</p>

  <p>Secondly, Byron was very unfortunate in another passage of the same
  poem:</p>

<p><!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>[272]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What varied wonders tempt us as they pass!</p>
      <p>The cow-pox, tractors, galvanism, and gas.</p>
      <p>In turns appear, to make the vulgar stare,</p>
      <p>Till the swoln bubble bursts&mdash;and all is air!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Three of the bubbles have burst to mighty ends. The metallic tractors
  are disused; but the force which, if anything, they put in action, is at
  this day, under the name of mesmerism, used, prohibited, respected,
  scorned, assailed, defended, asserted, denied, declared utterly obscure,
  and universally known. It was hard lines to select for candidates for
  oblivion not one of whom got in. I shall myself, I am assured, be some
  day cited for laughing at the great discovery of &mdash;&mdash;: the
  blank is left for my reader to fill up in his own way; but I think I
  shall not be so unlucky in four different ways.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">FALSIFIED PREDICTION.</p>

  <p>The narration before the fact, as prophecy has been called, sometimes
  quite as true as the narration after the fact, is very ridiculous when it
  is wrong. Why, the pre-narrator could not know; the post-narrator might
  have known. A good collection of unlucky predictions might be made: I
  hardly know one so fit to go with Byron's as that of the Rev. Daniel
  Rivers, already quoted, about Johnson's biographers. Peter Pindar<a
  name="NtA_434" href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> may be excused, as
  personal satire was his object, for addressing Boswell and Mrs. Piozzi<a
  name="NtA_435" href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Instead of adding splendor to his name,</p>
      <p>Your books are downright gibbets to his fame;</p>
      <p>You never with posterity can thrive,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Tis by the Rambler's death alone you live."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But Rivers, in prose narrative, was not so excusable. He says:</p>

<p><!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>[273]</span></p>

  <p>"As admirers of the learning and moral excellence of their hero, we
  glow at almost every page with indignation that his weaknesses and his
  failings should be disclosed to public view.... Johnson, after the luster
  he had reflected on the name of Thrale ... was to have his memory
  tortured and abused by her detested itch for scribbling. More injury, we
  will venture to affirm, has been done to the fame of Johnson by this Lady
  and her late biographical helpmate, than his most avowed enemies have
  been able to effect: and if his character becomes unpopular with some of
  his successors, it is to those gossiping friends he is indebted for the
  favor."</p>

  <p>Poor dear old Sam! the best known dead man alive! clever,
  good-hearted, logical, ugly bear! Where would he have been if it had not
  been for Boswell and Thrale, and their imitators? What would biography
  have been if Boswell had not shown how to write a life?</p>

  <p>Rivers is to be commended for not throwing a single Stone at Mrs.
  Thrale's second marriage. This poor lady begins to receive a little
  justice. The literary world seems to have found out that a blue-stocking
  dame who keeps open house for a set among them has a right, if it so
  please her, to marry again without taking measures to carry on the
  cake-shop. I was before my age in this respect: as a boy-reader of
  Boswell, and a few other things that fell in my way, I came to a
  clearness that the conduct of society towards Mrs. Piozzi was
  <i>blackguard</i>. She wanted nothing but what was in that day a woman's
  only efficient protection, a male relation with a brace of pistols, and a
  competent notion of using them.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">BYRON AND WORDSWORTH.</p>

  <p>Byron's mistake about Hallam in the Pindar story may be worth placing
  among absurdities. For elucidation, suppose that some poet were now to
  speak&mdash; <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <div class="poem">

  <p>and some critic were to call it nonsense, would that critic be
  laughing at Milton? Payne Knight,<a name="NtA_436"
  href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> in his <i>Taste</i>, translated part
  of Gray's <i>Bard</i> into Greek. Some of his lines are</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On which Hallam remarks: "The twelfth line [our first] is nonsense."
  And so it is, a poet can no more wet his tears with his groans than wet
  his ale with his whistle. Now this first line is from Pindar, but is only
  part of the sense; in full it is:</p>

  <p>Pindar's <span title="tengôn" class="grk"
  >&tau;&#x1F73;&gamma;&gamma;&omega;&nu;</span> must be Englished by
  <i>shedding</i>, and he stands alone in this use. He says, "shedding warm
  tears, he cried out loud, with groans." Byron speaks of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Classic Hallam, much renowned for Greek:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and represents him as criticising <i>the Greek</i> of all Payne's
  lines, and not discovering that "the lines" were Pindar's <!-- Page 275
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>[275]</span>until after
  publication. Byron was too much of a scholar to make this blunder
  himself: he either accepted the facts from report, or else took satirical
  licence. And why not? If you want to laugh at a person, and he will not
  give occasion, whose fault is it that you are obliged to make it? Hallam
  did criticise some of Payne Knight's Greek; but with the caution of his
  character, he remarked that possibly some of these queer phrases might be
  "critic-traps" justified by some one use of some one author. I remember
  well having a Latin essay to write at Cambridge, in which I took care to
  insert a few monstrous and unusual idioms from Cicero: a person with a
  Nizolius,<a name="NtA_437" href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> and
  without scruples may get scores of them. So when my tutor raised his
  voice against these oddities, I was up to him, for I came down upon him
  with Cicero, chapter and verse, and got round him. And so my own
  solecisms, many of them, passed unchallenged.</p>

  <p>Byron had more good in his nature than he was fond of letting out:
  whether he was a soured misanthrope, or whether his <i>vein</i> lay that
  way in poetry, and he felt it necessary to fit his demeanor to it, are
  matters far beyond me. Mr. Crabb Robinson<a name="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> told me the following story more than
  once. He was at Charles Lamb's chambers in the Temple when Wordsworth
  came in, with the new <i>Edinburgh Review</i> in his hand, and fume on
  his countenance. "These reviewers," said he, "put me out of patience!
  Here is a young man&mdash;they say he is a lord&mdash;who has written a
  volume of poetry; and these fellows, just because he is a lord, set upon
  him, laugh at him, and sneer at his writing. The young man will do
  something, if he goes on as he has begun. But these reviewers seem to
  think <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>[276]</span>that nobody may write poetry, unless he
  lives in a garret." Crabb Robinson told this long after to Lady Byron,
  who said, "Ah! if Byron had known that, he would never have attacked
  Wordsworth. He went one day to meet Wordsworth at dinner; when he came
  home I said, 'Well, how did the young poet get on with the old one?'
  'Why, to tell you the truth,' said he, 'I had but one feeling from the
  beginning of the visit to the end, and that was&mdash;<i>reverence</i>!'"
  Lady Byron told my wife that her husband had a very great respect for
  Wordsworth. I suppose he would have said&mdash;as the Archangel said to
  his Satan&mdash;"Our difference is po[li = e]tical."</p>

  <p>I suspect that Fielding would, if all were known, be ranked among the
  unlucky railers at supposed paradox. In his <i>Miscellanies</i> (1742,
  8vo) he wrote a satire on the Chrysippus or Guinea, an animal which
  multiplies itself by division, like the polypus. This he supposes to have
  been drawn up by Petrus Gualterus, meaning the famous usurer, Peter
  Walter. He calls it a paper "proper to be read before the
  R&mdash;&mdash;l Society": and next year, 1743, a quarto reprint was made
  to resemble a paper in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>. So far as I
  can make out, one object is ridicule of what the zoologists said about
  the polypus: a reprint in the form of the <i>Transactions</i> was
  certainly satire on the Society, not on Peter Walter and his knack of
  multiplying guineas.</p>

  <p>Old poets have recognized the quadrature of the circle as a well-known
  difficulty. Dante compares himself, when bewildered, to a geometer who
  cannot find the principle on which the circle is to be measured:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Quale è 'l geometra che tutto s' affige</p>
      <p>Per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritruova,</p>
      <p>Pensando qual principio ond' egli indige."<a name="NtA_439" href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>[277]</span></p>

  <p>And Quarles<a name="NtA_440" href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a>
  speaks as follows of the <i>summum bonum</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or is't a tart idea, to procure</p>
      <p>An edge, and keep the practic soul in ure,</p>
      <p>Like that dear chymic dust, or puzzling quadrature?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The poetic notion of the quadrature must not be forgotten.
  Aristophanes, in the <i>Birds</i>, introduces a geometer who announces
  his intention to <i>make a square circle</i>. Pope, in the
  <i>Dunciad</i>, delivers himself as follows, with a Greek pronunciation
  rather strange in a translator of Homer. Probably Pope recognized, as a
  general rule, the very common practice of throwing back the accent in
  defiance of quantity, seen in o´rator, au´ditor, se´nator, ca´tenary,
  etc.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mad <i>Mathesis</i> alone was unconfined,</p>
      <p>Too mad for mere material chains to bind,&mdash;</p>
      <p>Now to pure space lifts her ecstatic stare,</p>
      <p>Now, running round the circle, finds it square."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The author's note explains that this "regards the wild and fruitless
  attempts of squaring the circle." The poetic idea seems to be that the
  geometers try to make a square circle. Disraeli quotes it as "finds
  <i>its</i> square," but the originals do not support this reading.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">DE BECOURT.</p>

  <p>I have come in the way of a work, entitled <i>The Grave of Human
  Philosophies</i> (1827), translated from the French of R. de Bécourt<a
  name="NtA_441" href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> by A. Dalmas. It
  supports, but I suspect not very accurately, the views of the old Hindu
  books. <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page278"></a>[278]</span>That the sun is only 450 miles from us,
  and only 40 miles in diameter, may be passed over; my affair is with the
  state of mind into which persons of M. Bécourt's temperament are brought
  by a fancy. He fully grants, as certain, four millions of years as the
  duration of the Hindu race, and 1956 as that of the universe. It must be
  admitted he is not wholly wrong in saying that our errors about the
  universe proceed from our ignorance of its origin, antiquity,
  organization, laws, and final destination. Living in an age of light, he
  "avails himself of that opportunity" to remove this veil of darkness,
  etc. The system of the Brahmins is the only true one: he adds that it has
  never before been attempted, as it could not be obtained except by him.
  The author requests us first, to lay aside prejudice; next, to read all
  he says in the order in which he says it: we may then pronounce judgment
  upon a work which begins by taking the Brahmins for granted. All the
  paradoxers make the same requests. They do not see that compliance would
  bring thousands of systems before the world every year: we have scores as
  it is. How is a poor candid inquirer to choose. Fortunately, the mind has
  its grand jury as well as its little one: and it will not put a book upon
  its trial without a <i>prima facie</i> case in its favor. And with most
  of those who really search for themselves, that case is never made out
  without evidence of knowledge, standing out clear and strong, in the book
  to be examined.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">BEQUEST OF A QUADRATURE.</p>

  <p>There is much private history which will never come to light, <i>caret
  quia vate sacro</i>,<a name="NtA_442" href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a>
  because no Budgeteer comes across it. Many years ago a man of business,
  whose life was passed in banking, amused his leisure with quadrature, was
  successful of course, and bequeathed the result in a sealed book, which
  the legatee was enjoined not to sell <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>[279]</span>under a thousand
  pounds. The true ratio was 3.1416: I have the anecdote from the legatee's
  executor, who opened the book. That a banker should square the circle is
  very credible: but how could a City man come by the notion that a
  thousand pounds could be got for it? A friend of mine, one of the twins
  of my zodiac, will spend a thousand pounds, if he have not done it
  already, in black and white cyclometry: but I will answer for it that he,
  a man of sound business notions, never entertained the idea of <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> recouping him, as they now say. I speak of
  individual success: of course if a company were formed, especially if it
  were of unlimited lie-ability, the shares would be taken. No offence;
  there is nothing but what a pun will either sanctify, justify, or
  nullify:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It comes o'er the soul like the sweet South</p>
      <p>That breathes upon a bank of <i>vile hits</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The shares would be at a premium of 3&#x215B; on the day after issue.
  If they presented me with the number of shares I deserve, for suggestion
  and advertisement, I should stand up for the Archpriest of St. Vitus<a
  name="NtA_443" href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> and 3-1/5, with a view
  to a little more gold on the bridge.</p>

  <p>I now insert a couple of reviews, one about Cyclopædias, one about
  epistolary collections. Should any reader wish for explanation of this
  insertion, I ask him to reflect a moment, and imagine me set to justify
  all the additions now before him! In truth these reviews are the
  repositories of many odds and ends: they were not made to the books; the
  materials were in my notes, and the books came as to a ready-made clothes
  shop, and found what would fit them. Many remember Curll's<a
  name="NtA_444" href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> bequest of some very
  good titles <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page280"></a>[280]</span>which only wanted treatises written to
  them. Well! here were some tolerable reviews&mdash;as times
  go&mdash;which only wanted books fitted to them. Accordingly, some tags
  were made to join on the books; and then as the reader sees.</p>

  <p>I should find it hard to explain why the insertion is made in this
  place rather than another. But again, suppose I were put to make such an
  explanation throughout the volume. The improver who laid out grounds and
  always studied what he called <i>unexpectedness</i>, was asked what name
  he gave it for those who walked over his grounds a second time. He was
  silenced; but I have an answer: It is that which is given by the very
  procedure of taking up my book a second time.</p>

  <p>The two editions above described are completed at the same time: and
  they stand at the head of the two great branches into which pantological
  undertakings are divided, as at once the largest and the best of their
  classes.</p>

  <p>When the works are brought together, the first thing that strikes the
  eye is the syllable of difference in the names. The word
  <i>Cyclopædia</i> is a bit of modern purism. Though <span
  title="enkuklopaideia" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&gamma;&kappa;&upsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&pi;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span><a

  Greek of Greece, we learn from both Pliny<a name="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> and Quintilian<a name="NtA_448"
  href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a> that the circle <!-- Page 281
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[281]</span>of the
  sciences was so called by the Greeks, and Vitruvius<a name="NtA_449"
  href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> has thence naturalized
  <i>encyclium</i> in Latin. Nevertheless we admit that the initial
  <i>en</i> would have euphonized but badly with the word <i>Penny</i>: and
  the <i>English Cyclopædia</i> is the augmented, revised, and distributed
  edition of the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>. It has indeed been said that
  Cyclopædia should mean the education <i>of</i> a circle, just as
  Cyropædia is the education <i>of</i> Cyrus. But this is easily upset by
  Aristotle's word <span title="kuklophoria" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&upsilon;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>,<a
  name="NtA_450" href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> motion <i>in</i> a
  circle, and by many other cases, for which see the lexicon.</p>

  <p>The earliest printed Encyclopædia of this kind was perhaps the famous
  "myrrour of the worlde," which Caxton<a name="NtA_451"
  href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> translated from the French and
  printed in 1480. The original Latin is of the thirteenth century, or
  earlier. This is a collection of very short treatises. In or shortly
  after 1496 appeared the <i>Margarita Philosophica</i> of Gregory
  Reisch,<a name="NtA_452" href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> the same we
  must suppose, who was confessor to the Emperor Maximilian.<a
  name="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> This is again a
  collection of treatises, of much more pretension: and the estimation
  formed of it is proved by the number of editions it went through. In 1531
  appeared the little collection of <i>works</i> of Ringelberg,<a
  name="NtA_454" href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> which is truly called
  an Encyclopædia by <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page282"></a>[282]</span>Morhof, though the thumbs and fingers of
  the two hands will meet over the length of its one volume. There are more
  small collections; but we pass on to the first work to which the name of
  <i>Encyclopædia</i> is given. This is a ponderous <i>Scientiarum Omnium
  Encyclopædia</i> of Alsted,<a name="NtA_455"
  href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> in four folio volumes, commonly bound
  in two: published in 1629 and again in 1649; the true parent of all the
  Encyclopædias, or collections of treatises, or works in which that
  character predominates. The first great <i>dictionary</i> may perhaps be
  taken to be Hofman's <i>Lexicon Universale</i><a name="NtA_456"
  href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> (1677); but Chambers's<a
  name="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> (so called)
  <i>Dictionary</i> (1728) has a better claim. And we support our proposed
  nomenclature by observing that Alsted accidentally called his work
  <i>En</i>cyclopædia, and Chambers simply Cyclopædia.</p>

  <p>We shall make one little extract from the <i>myrrour</i>, and one from
  Ringelberg. Caxton's author makes a singular remark for his time; and one
  well worthy of attention. The grammar rules of a language, he says, must
  have been invented by foreigners: "And whan any suche tonge was perfytely
  had and usyd amonge any people, than other people not used to the same
  tonge caused rulys to be made wherby they myght lerne the same tonge ...
  and suche rulys be called the gramer of that tonge." Ringelberg says that
  if the right nostril bleed, the little finger of the right hand should be
  crooked, and squeezed with great force; and the same for the left.</p>

<p><!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[283]</span></p>

  <p>We pass on to <i>the</i> Encyclopédie,<a name="NtA_458"
  href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> commenced in 1751; the work which
  has, in many minds, connected the word <i>encyclopædist</i> with that of
  <i>infidel</i>. Readers of our day are surprised when they look into this
  work, and wonder what has become of all the irreligion. The truth is,
  that the work&mdash;though denounced <i>ab ovo</i><a name="NtA_459"
  href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> on account of the character of its
  supporters&mdash;was neither adapted, nor intended, to excite any
  particular remark on the subject: no work of which D'Alembert<a
  name="NtA_460" href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> was co-editor would
  have been started on any such plan. For, first, he was a real
  <i>sceptic</i>: that is, doubtful, with a mind not made up. Next, he
  valued his quiet more than anything; and would as soon have gone to sleep
  over an hornet's nest as have contemplated a systematic attack upon
  either religion or government. As to Diderot<a name="NtA_461"
  href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a>&mdash;of whose varied career of
  thought it is difficult to fix the character of any one moment, but who
  is very frequently taken among us for a pure atheist&mdash;we will quote
  one sentence from the article "<i>Encyclopédie</i>," which he wrote
  himself:&mdash;"Dans le moral, il n'y a que Dieu qui doit servir de
  modèle a 1'homme; dans les art, que la nature."<a name="NtA_462"
  href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A great many readers in our country have but a very hazy idea of the
  difference between the political Encyclopædia, as we may call it, and the
  <i>Encyclopédie Méthodique</i>,<a name="NtA_463"
  href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> which we always take to be
  meant&mdash;whether rightly or not we cannot tell&mdash;when we hear of
  the "great French Encyclopædia." This work, which takes much from its
  <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page284"></a>[284]</span>predecessor, professing to correct it, was
  begun in 1792, and finished in 1832. There are 166 volumes of text, and
  6439 plates, which are sometimes incorporated with the text, sometimes
  make about 40 more volumes. This is still the monster production of the
  kind; though probably the German Cyclopædia of Ersch and Gruber,<a
  name="NtA_464" href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a> which was begun in
  1818, and is still in progress, will beat it in size. The great French
  work is a collection of dictionaries; it consists of Cyclopædias of all
  the separate branches of knowledge. It is not a work, but a collection of
  works, one or another department is to be bought from time to time; but
  we never heard of a complete set for sale in one lot. As ships grow
  longer and longer, the question arises what limit there is to the length.
  One answer is, that it will never do to try such a length that the stern
  will be rotten before the prow is finished. This wholesome rule has not
  been attended to in the matter before us; the earlier parts of the great
  French work were antiquated before the whole were completed: something of
  the kind will happen to that of Ersch and Gruber.</p>

  <p>The production of a great dictionary of either of the kinds is far
  from an easy task. There is one way of managing the <i>En</i>cyclopædia
  which has been largely resorted to; indeed, we may say that no such work
  has been free from it. This plan is to throw all the attention upon the
  great treatises, and to resort to paste and scissors, or some process of
  equally easy character, for the smaller articles. However it may be done,
  it has been the rule that the Encyclopædia of treatises should have its
  supplemental Dictionary of a very incomplete character. It is true that
  the treatises are intended to do a good deal; and that the Index, if it
  be good, knits the treatises and the dictionary into one whole of
  reference. Still there are two stools, and between them a great deal will
  fall to the ground. The dictionary portion of the <i>Britannica</i> is
  not to be compared with its <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>[285]</span>treatises; the part called Miscellaneous
  and Lexicographical in the <i>Metropolitana</i><a name="NtA_465"
  href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> is a great failure. The defect is
  incompleteness. The biographical portion, for example, of the Britannica
  is very defective: of many names of note in literature and science, which
  become known to the reader from the treatises, there is no account
  whatever in the dictionary. So that the reader who has learnt the results
  of a life in astronomy, for example, must go to some other work to know
  when that life began and ended. This defect has run through all the
  editions; it is in the casting of the work. The reader must learn to take
  the results at their true value, which is not small. He must accustom
  himself to regard the Britannica as a splendid body of treatises on all
  that can be called heads of knowledge, both greater and smaller; with
  help from the accompanying dictionary, but not of the most complete
  character. Practically, we believe, this defect cannot be avoided: two
  plans of essentially different structure cannot be associated on the
  condition of each or either being allowed to abbreviate the other.</p>

  <p>The defect of all others which it is most difficult to avoid is
  inequality of performance. Take any dictionary you please, of any kind
  which requires the association of a number of contributors, and this
  defect must result. We do not merely mean that some will do their work
  better than others; this of course: we mean that there will be structural
  differences of execution, affecting the relative extent of the different
  parts of the whole, as well as every other point by which a work can be
  judged. A wise editor will not attempt any strong measures of correction:
  he will remember that if some portions be below the rest, which is a
  disadvantage, it follows that some portions must be above the rest, which
  is an advantage. The only practical level, if <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>[286]</span>level there must be, is
  that of mediocrity, if not of absolute worthlessness: any attempt to
  secure equality of strength will result in equality of weakness.
  Efficient development may be cut down into meager brevity, and in this
  way only can apparent equality of plan be secured throughout. It is far
  preferable to count upon differences of execution, and to proceed upon
  the acknowledged expectation that the prominent merits of the work will
  be settled by the accidental character of the contributors; it being held
  impossible that any editorial efforts can secure a uniform standard of
  goodness. Wherever the greatest power is found, it should be suffered to
  produce its natural effect. There are, indeed, critics who think that the
  merit of a book, like the strength of a chain, is that of its weakest
  part: but there are others who know that the parallel does not hold, and
  who will remember that the union of many writers must show exaggeration
  of the inequalities which almost always exist in the production of one
  person. The true plan is to foster all the good that can be got, and to
  give development in the directions in which most resources are found: a
  Cyclopædia, like a plant, should grow towards the light.</p>

  <p>The <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> had its share of this kind of defect or
  excellence, according to the way in which the measure is taken. The
  circumstance is not so much noticed as might be expected, and this
  because many a person is in the habit of using such a dictionary chiefly
  with relation to one subject, his own; and more still want it for the
  pure dictionary purpose, which does not go much beyond the meaning of the
  word. But the person of full and varied reference feels the differences;
  and criticism makes capital of them. The Useful Knowledge Society was
  always odious to the organs of religious bigotry; and one of them,
  adverting to the fact that geography was treated with great ability, and
  most unusual fullness, in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>, announced it by
  making it the sole merit of <!-- Page 287 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page287"></a>[287]</span>the work that, with sufficient addition,
  it would make a tolerably good gazetteer.</p>

  <p>Some of our readers may still have hanging about them the feelings
  derived from this old repugnance of a class to all that did not associate
  direct doctrinal teaching of religion with every attempt to communicate
  knowledge. I will take one more instance, by way of pointing out the
  extent to which stupidity can go. If there be an astronomical fact of the
  telescopic character which, next after Saturn's ring and Jupiter's
  satellites, was known to all the world, it was the existence of
  multitudes of double stars, treble stars, etc. A respectable quarterly of
  the theological cast, which in mercy we refrain from naming, was ignorant
  of this common knowledge,&mdash;imagined that the mention of such systems
  was a blunder of one of the writers in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>, and
  lashed the presumed ignorance of the statement in the following words,
  delivered in April, 1837:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We have forgotten the name of that Sidrophel who lately discovered
  that the fixed stars were not single stars, but appear in the heavens
  like soles at Billingsgate, in pairs; while a second astronomer, under
  the influence of that competition in trade which the political economists
  tell us is so advantageous to the public, professes to show us, through
  his superior telescope, that the apparently single stars are really
  three. Before such wondrous mandarins of science, how continually must
  <i>homunculi</i> like ourselves keep in the background, lest we come
  between the wind and their nobility."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Certainly these little men ought to have kept in the background; but
  they did not: and the growing reputation of the work which they assailed
  has chronicled them in literary history; grubs in amber.</p>

  <p>This important matter of inequality, which has led us so far, is one
  to which the <i>Encyclopædia</i> is as subject as the <i>Cyclopædia</i>;
  but it is not so easily recognized as a fault. <!-- Page 288 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>[288]</span>We receive the first
  book as mainly a collection of treatises: we know their authors, and we
  treat them as individuals. We see, for instance, the names of two leading
  writers on Optics, Brewster<a name="NtA_466"
  href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> and Herschel.<a name="NtA_467"
  href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> It would not at all surprise us if
  either of these writers should be found criticising the other by name,
  even though the very view opposed should be contained in the same
  <i>Encyclopædia</i> with the criticism. And in like manner, we should
  hold it no wonder if we found some third writer not comparable to either
  of those we have named. It is not so in the <i>Cyclopædia</i>: here we do
  not know the author, except by inference from a list of which we never
  think while consulting the work. We do not dissent from this or that
  author: we blame the book.</p>

  <p>The <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> is an old friend. Though it holds a
  proud place in our present literature, yet the time was when it stood by
  itself, more complete and more clear than anything which was to be found
  elsewhere. There must be studious men alive in plenty who remember when
  they were studious boys, what a literary luxury it was to pass a few days
  in the house of a friend who had a copy of this work. The present edition
  is a worthy successor of those which went before. The last three
  editions, terminating in 1824, 1842, and 1861, seem to show that a lunar
  cycle cannot pass without an amended and augmented edition. Detailed
  criticism is out of the question; but we may notice the effective
  continuance of the plan of giving general historical dissertations on the
  progress of knowledge. Of some of these dissertations we have had to take
  separate notice; and all will be referred to in our ordinary treatment of
  current literature.<a name="NtA_468"
  href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The literary excellence of these two extensive undertakings is of the
  same high character. To many this will <!-- Page 289 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>[289]</span>need justification:
  they will not easily concede to the cheap and recent work a right to
  stand on the same shelf with the old and tried magazine, newly
  replenished with the best of everything. Those who are cognizant by use
  of the kind of material which fills the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> will need
  no further evidence: to others we shall quote a very remarkable and
  certainly very complete testimony. The <i>Cyclopædia of the Physical
  Sciences</i>, published by Dr. Nichol<a name="NtA_469"
  href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> in 1857 (noticed by us, April 4), is
  one of the most original of our special dictionaries. The following is an
  extract from the editor's preface:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When I assented to Mr. Griffin's proposal that I should edit such a
  Cyclopædia, I had it in my mind that I might make the <i>scissors</i>
  eminently effective. Alas! on narrowly examining our best Cyclopædias, I
  found that the scissors had become blunted through too frequent and
  vigorous use. One great exception exists: viz., the <i>Penny
  Cyclopædia</i> of Charles Knight.<a name="NtA_470"
  href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> The cheapest and the least
  pretending, it is really the most philosophical of our <i>scientific</i>
  dictionaries. It is not made up of a series of treatises, some good and
  many indifferent, but is a thorough <i>Dictionary</i>, well proportioned
  and generally written by the best men of the time. The more closely it is
  examined, the more deeply will our obligation be felt to the intelligence
  and conscientiousness of its projector and editor."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After Dr. Nichol's candid and amusing announcement of his scissorial
  purpose, it is but fair to state that nothing of the kind was ultimately
  carried into effect, even upon the work in which he found so much to
  praise. I quote this testimony because it is of a peculiar kind.</p>

<p><!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>[290]</span></p>

  <p>The success of the <i>Penny Magazine</i> led Mr. Charles Knight in
  1832 to propose to the Useful Knowledge Society a Cyclopædia in weekly
  penny numbers. These two works stamp the name of the projector on the
  literature of our day in very legible characters. Eight volumes of 480
  pages each were contemplated; and Mr. Long<a name="NtA_471"
  href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> and Mr. Knight were to take the joint
  management. The plan embraced a popular account of Art and Science, with
  very brief biographical and geographical information. The early numbers
  of the work had some of the <i>Penny Magazine</i> character: no one can
  look at the pictures of the Abbot and Abbess in their robes without
  seeing this. By the time the second volume was completed, it was clearly
  seen that the plan was working out its own extension: a great development
  of design was submitted to, and Mr. Long became sole editor. Contributors
  could not be found to make articles of the requisite power in the
  assigned space. One of them told us that when he heard of the eight
  volumes, happening to want a shelf to be near at hand for containing the
  work as it went on, he ordered it to be made to hold twenty-five volumes
  easily. But the inexorable logic of facts beat him after all: for the
  complete work contained twenty-six volumes and two thick volumes of
  Supplement.</p>

  <p>The penny issue was brought to an end by the state of the law, which
  required, in 1833, that the first and last page of everything sold
  separately should contain the name and address of the printer. The penny
  numbers contained this imprint on the fold of the outer leaf: and <i>qui
  tam</i><a name="NtA_472" href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> informations
  were laid against the agents in various towns. <!-- Page 291 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>[291]</span>It became necessary to
  call in the stock; and the penny issue was abandoned. Monthly parts were
  substituted, which varied in bulk, as the demands of the plan became more
  urgent, and in price from one sixpence to three. The second volume of
  Supplement appeared in 1846, and during the fourteen years of issue no
  one monthly part was ever behind its time. This result is mainly due to
  the peculiar qualities of Mr. Long, who unites the talents of the scholar
  and the editor in a degree which is altogether unusual. If any one should
  imagine that a mixed mass of contributors is a punctual piece of
  machinery, let him take to editing upon that hypothesis, and he shall see
  what he shall see and learn what he shall learn.</p>

  <p>The <i>English</i> contains about ten per cent more matter than the
  <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> and its supplements; including the third
  supplementary volume of 1848, which we now mention for the first time.
  The literary work of the two editions cost within 500<i>l.</i> and
  50,000<i>l.</i>: that of the two editions of the <i>Britannica</i> cost
  41,000<i>l.</i> But then it is to be remembered that the
  <i>Britannica</i> had matter to begin upon, which had been paid for in
  the former editions. Roughly speaking, it is probable that the authorship
  of a page of the same size would have cost nearly the same in one as in
  the other.</p>

  <p>The longest articles in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i> were "Rome" in 98
  columns and "Yorkshire" in 86 columns. The only article which can be
  called a treatise is the Astronomer Royal's "Gravitation," founded on the
  method of Newton in the eleventh section, but carried to a much greater
  extent. In the <i>English Cyclopædia</i>, the longest article of
  geography is "Asia," in 45 columns. In natural history the antelopes
  demand 36 columns. In biography, "Wellington" uses up 42 columns, and his
  great military opponent 41 columns. In the division of Arts and Sciences,
  which includes much of a social and commercial character, the length of
  articles often depends upon the state of the <!-- Page 292 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>[292]</span>times with regard to
  the subject. Our readers would not hit the longest article of this
  department in twenty guesses: it is "Deaf and Dumb" in 60 columns. As
  other specimens, we may cite Astronomy, 19; Banking, 36; Blind, 24;
  British Museum, 35; Cotton, 27; Drama, 26; Gravitation, 50; Libraries,
  50; Painting, 34; Railways, 18; Sculpture, 36; Steam, etc., 37; Table,
  40; Telegraph, 30; Welsh language and literature, 39; Wool, 21. These are
  the long articles of special subdivisions: the words under which the
  <i>En</i>cyclopædia gives treatises are not so prominent. As in Algebra,
  10; Chemistry, 12; Geometry, 8; Logic, 14; Mathematics, 5; Music, 9. But
  the difference between the collection of treatises and the dictionary may
  be illustrated thus: though "Mathematics" have only five columns,
  "Mathematics, recent terminology of," has eight: and this article we
  believe to be by Mr. Cayley,<a name="NtA_473"
  href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a> who certainly ought to know his
  subject, being himself a large manufacturer of the new terms which he
  explains. Again, though "Music" <i>in genere</i>, as the schoolmen said,
  has only nine columns, "Temperament and Tuning," has eight, and "Chord"
  alone has two. And so on.</p>

  <p>In a dictionary of this kind it is difficult to make a total clearance
  of <i>personality</i>: by which we mean that exhibition of peculiar
  opinion which is offensive to taste when it is shifted from the
  individual on the corporate book. The treatise of the known author may,
  as we have said, carry that author's controversies on its own shoulders:
  and even his crotchets, if we may use such a word. But <!-- Page 293
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>[293]</span>the dictionary
  should not put itself into antagonism with general feeling, nor even with
  the feelings of classes. We refer particularly to the ordinary and
  editorial teaching of the article. If, indeed, the writer, being at issue
  with mankind, should confess the difference, and give abstract of his
  full grounds, the case is altered: the editor then, as it were, admits a
  correspondent to a statement of his own individual views. The dictionary
  portion of the Britannica is quite clear of any lapses on this point, so
  far as we know: the treatises and dissertations rest upon their authors.
  The Penny Cyclopædia was all but clear: and great need was there that it
  should have been so. The Useful Knowledge Society, starting on the
  principle of perfect neutrality in politics and religion, was obliged to
  keep strict watch against the entrance of all attempt even to look over
  the hedge. There were two&mdash;we believe only two&mdash;instances of
  what we have called personality. The first was in the article "Bunyan."
  It is worth while to extract all that is said&mdash;in an article of
  thirty lines&mdash;about a writer who is all but universally held to be
  the greatest master of allegory that ever wrote:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"His works were collected in two volumes, folio, 1736-7: among them
  'The Pilgrim's Progress' has attained the greatest notoriety. If a
  judgment is to be formed of the merits of a book by the number of times
  it has been reprinted, and the many languages into which it has been
  translated, no production in English literature is superior to this
  coarse allegory. On a composition which has been extolled by Dr. Johnson,
  and which in our own times has received a very high critical opinion in
  its favor [probably Southey], it is hazardous to venture a disapproval,
  and we, perhaps, speak the opinion of a small minority when we confess
  that to us it appears to be mean, jejune and wearisome."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>&mdash;If the unfortunate critic who thus individualized himself had
  been a sedulous reader of Bunyan, his power over <!-- Page 294 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>[294]</span>English would not have
  been so <i>jejune</i> as to have needed that fearful word. This little
  bit of criticism excited much amusement at the time of its publication:
  but it was so thoroughly exceptional and individual that it was seldom or
  never charged on the book. The second instance occurred in the article
  "Socinians." It had been arranged that the head-words of Christian sects
  should be intrusted to members of the sects themselves, on the
  understanding that the articles should simply set forth the accounts
  which the sects themselves give of their own doctrines. Thus the article
  on the Roman Church was written by Dr. Wiseman.<a name="NtA_474"
  href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> But the Unitarians were not allowed
  to come within the rule: as in other quarters, they were treated as the
  gypsies of Christianity. Under the head "Socinians"&mdash;a name
  repudiated by themselves&mdash;an opponent was allowed not merely to
  state their alleged doctrines in his own way, but to apply strong terms,
  such as "audacious unfairness," to some of their doings. The protests
  which were made against this invasion of the understanding produced, in
  due time, the article "Unitarians," written by one of that persuasion. We
  need not say that these errors have been amended in the English
  Cyclopædia: and our chief purpose in mentioning them is to remark, that
  this is all we can find on the points in question against twenty-eight
  large volumes produced by an editor whose task was monthly, and whose
  issue was never delayed a single hour. How much was arrested before
  publication none but himself can say. We have not alluded to one or two
  remonstrances on questions of absolute fact, which are beside the present
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Both kinds of encyclopædic works have been fashioned upon
  predecessors, from the very earliest which had a predecessor to be
  founded upon; and the undertakings before us will be themselves the
  ancestors of a line of successors. Those who write in such collections
  should be <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page295"></a>[295]</span>careful what they say, for no one can tell
  how long a mis-statement may live. On this point we will give the history
  of a pair of epithets. When the historian De Thou<a name="NtA_475"
  href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> died, and left the splendid library
  which was catalogued by Bouillaud<a name="NtA_476"
  href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a> and the brothers Dupuis<a
  name="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a> (Bullialdus and
  Puteanus), there was a manuscript of De Thou's friend Vieta,<a
  name="NtA_478" href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> the <i>Harmonicon
  C&oelig;leste</i>, of which it is on record, under Bouillaud's hand, that
  he himself lent it to Cosmo de' Medici,<a name="NtA_479"
  href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> to which must be added that M.
  Libri<a name="NtA_480" href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> found it in
  the Magliabecchi Library at Florence in our own day. Bouillaud, it seems,
  entirely forgot what he had done. Something, probably, that Peter Dupuis
  said to Bouillaud, while they were at work on the catalogue, remained on
  his memory, and was published by him in 1645, long after; to the effect
  that Dupuis lent the manuscript to Mersenne,<a name="NtA_481"
  href="#Nt_481"><sup>[481]</sup></a> from whom it was procured by some
  intending plagiarist, who would not give it back. This was repeated by
  Sherburne,<a name="NtA_482" href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> in 1675,
  who speaks of the work, which "being communicated to Mersennus was, by
  some perfidious acquaintance of that honest-minded person,
  surreptitiously taken from him, and irrecoverably lost or suppressed, to
  the unspeakable detriment of the lettered world." Now let the <!-- Page
  296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>[296]</span>reader
  look through the dictionaries of the last century and the present,
  scientific or general, at the article, "Vieta," and he will be amused
  with the constant recurrence of "honest-minded" Mersenne, and his
  "surreptitious" acquaintance. We cannot have seen less than thirty copies
  of these epithets.</p>

  only just completed by the publication of its Table of Contents and

  href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> of English men of science, which
  dovetails with the one before us, and is for the most part of a prior
  date. The two should be bound up together. The smaller collection runs
  from 1562 to 1682; the larger, from 1606 to past 1700. We shall speak of
  the two as the Museum collection and the Macclesfield collection. And
  near them should be placed, in every scientific library, the valuable
  collection published, by Mr. Edleston,<a name="NtA_485"
  href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> for Trinity College, in 1850.</p>

  <p>The history of these letters runs back to famous John Collins, the
  attorney-general of the mathematics, as he has been called, who wrote to
  everybody, heard from everybody, and sent copies of everybody's letter to
  everybody else. He was in England what Mersenne<a name="NtA_486"
  href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a> was in France: as early as 1671, E.
  Bernard<a name="NtA_487" href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a> addresses
  him as "the very Mersennus and intelligence of this age." John Collins<a
  name="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> was never more than
  accountant to the Excise Office, to which he was promoted from teaching
  writing and ciphering, at the Restoration: he died in 1682. We have had a
  man of the same office in our own day, the late Prof. Schumacher,<a
  name="NtA_489" href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> who made the little
  Danish Observatory of Altona the junction of all the lines by which
  astronomical information was conveyed from one country to another. When
  the collision took place between Denmark and the Duchies, the English
  Government, moved by the Astronomical Society, instructed its diplomatic
  agents to represent strongly to the Danish Government, when occasion
  should arise, the great importance of the Observatory of Altona to the
  astronomical communications of the whole world. But Schumacher had his
  own celebrated journal, the <i>Astronomische Nachrichten</i>, by which to
  work out part of his plan; private correspondence was his supplementary
  assistant. Collins had only correspondence to rely on. Nothing is better
  known than that it was Collins's collection which furnished the materials
  put forward by the Committee of the Royal Society in 1712, as a defence
  of Newton against the partisans of Leibnitz. The noted <i>Commercium
  Epistolicum</i> is but the abbreviation of a title which runs on with "D.
  Johannis Collins et aliorum ..."</p>

  <p>The whole of this collection passed into the hands of <!-- Page 298
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>[298]</span>William
  Jones,<a name="NtA_490" href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> the father of
  the Indian Judge of the same name, who died in 1749. Jones was originally
  a teacher, but was presented with a valuable sinecure by the interest of
  George, second Earl of Macclesfield, the mover of the bill for the change
  of style in Britain, who died President of the Royal Society. This change
  of style may perhaps be traced to the union of energies which were
  brought into concert by the accident of a common teacher: Lord
  Macclesfield and Lord Chesterfield,<a name="NtA_491"
  href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a> the mover and the seconder, and
  Daval,<a name="NtA_492" href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> who drew the
  bill, were pupils of De Moivre.<a name="NtA_493"
  href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a> Jones, who was a respectable
  mathematician though not an inventor, collected the largest mathematical
  library of his day, and became possessor of the papers of Collins, which
  contained those of Oughtred<a name="NtA_494"
  href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> and others. Some of these papers
  passed into the custody of the Royal Society: but the bulk was either
  bequeathed to, or purchased by, Lord Macclesfield; and thus they found
  their way to Shirburn Castle, where they still remain.</p>

  <p>A little before 1836, this collection attracted the attention of a
  searching inquirer into points of mathematical history, the late
  Professor Rigaud,<a name="NtA_495" href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a>
  who died in 1839. He examined the whole collection of letters, obtained
  Lord Macclesfield's consent to their publication, and induced the Oxford
  Press to bear the expense. It must be particularly remembered that there
  still remains at Shirburn Castle a <!-- Page 299 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>[299]</span>valuable mass of
  non-epistolary manuscripts. So far as we can see, the best chance of a
  further examination and publication lies in public encouragement of the
  collection now before us: the Oxford Press might be induced to extend its
  operations if it were found that the results were really of interest to
  the literary and scientific world. Rigaud died before the work was
  completed, and the publication was actually made by one of his sons, S.
  Jordan Rigaud,<a name="NtA_496" href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> who
  died Bishop of Antigua. But this publication was little noticed, for the
  reasons given. The completion now published consists of a sufficient
  table of contents, of the briefest kind, by Professor De Morgan, and an
  excellent index by the Rev. John Rigaud.<a name="NtA_497"
  href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> The work is now fairly started on its
  career.</p>

  <p>If we were charged to write a volume with the title "Small things in
  their connection with great," we could not do better than choose the
  small part of this collection of letters as our basis. The names, as well
  as the contents, are both great and small: the great names, those which
  are known to every mathematician who has any infusion of the history of
  his pursuit, are Briggs,<a name="NtA_498"

  <p>The first who appears on the scene is the celebrated Oughtred, who is
  related to have died of joy at the Restoration: but it should be added,
  by way of excuse, that he was eighty-six years old. He is an animal of
  extinct race, an Eton mathematician. Few Eton men, even of the minority
  which knows what a sliding rule is, are aware that the inventor was of
  their own school and college: but they may be excused, for Dr. Hutton,<a
  name="NtA_553" href="#Nt_553"><sup>[553]</sup></a> so far as his
  Dictionary bears witness, seems not to have known it any more than they.
  A glance at one of his letters reminds us of a letter from the Astronomer
  Royal on the discovery of Neptune, which we printed March 20, 1847. Mr.
  Airy<a name="NtA_554" href="#Nt_554"><sup>[554]</sup></a> there contends,
  and proves it both by Leverrier<a name="NtA_555"
  href="#Nt_555"><sup>[555]</sup></a> and by Adams,<a name="NtA_556"
  href="#Nt_556"><sup>[556]</sup></a> that the limited publication of a
  private letter is more efficient than the more general publication of a
  printed memoir. The same may be true of a dead letter, as opposed to a
  dead book. Our eye was caught by a letter of Oughtred (1629), containing
  systematic use of contractions for the words <i>sine</i>, <i>cosine</i>,
  etc., prefixed to the symbol of the angle. This is so very important a
  step, simple as it is, that Euler<a name="NtA_557"
  href="#Nt_557"><sup>[557]</sup></a> is justly held to have greatly
  advanced trigonometry by its introduction. Nobody that we know of has
  noticed that Oughtred was master of the improvement, and willing to have
  taught it, if people would have learnt. After looking at his dead letter,
  we naturally turned to his dead book on trigonometry, and there we found
  the abbreviations <i>s</i>, <i>sco</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>tco</i>, <i>se</i>,
  <i>seco</i>, regularly established as part of the system of the work. But
  not one of those who have investigated the contending claims of Euler and
  Thomas <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>[304]</span>Simpson<a name="NtA_558"
  href="#Nt_558"><sup>[558]</sup></a> has chanced to know of Oughtred's
  "Trigonometrie": and the present revival is due to his letter, not to his
  book.</p>

  <p>A casual reader, turning over the pages, would imagine that almost all
  the letters had been printed, either in the General Dictionary, or in
  Birch,<a name="NtA_559" href="#Nt_559"><sup>[559]</sup></a> etc.: so
  often does the supplementary remark begin with "this letter has been
  printed in &mdash;&mdash;." For ourselves we thought, until we counted,
  that a large majority of the letters had been given, either in whole or
  in part. But the positive strikes the mind more forcibly than the
  negative: we find that all of which any portion has been in type makes up
  very little more than a quarter; the cases in which the whole letter is
  given being a minority of this quarter. The person who has been best
  ransacked is Flamsteed: of 36 letters from him, 34 had been previously
  given in whole or in part. Of 59 letters to and from Newton, only 17 have
  been culled.</p>

  <p>The letters have been modernized in spelling, and, to some extent, in
  algebraical notation; it also seems that conjectural methods of
  introducing interpolations into the text have been necessary. For all
  this we are sorry: the scientific value of the collection is little
  altered, but its literary value is somewhat lowered. But it could not be
  helped: the printers could not work from the originals, and Professor
  Rigaud had to copy everything himself. A fac-simile must have been the
  work of more time than he had to give: had he attempted it, his death
  would have cut short the whole undertaking, instead of allowing him to
  prepare everything but a preface, and to superintend the printing of one
  of the volumes. We may also add, that we believe we have notices of
  <i>all</i> the letters in the Macclesfield collection. We judge this
  because several which are too trivial to print are numbered and
  described; and those would certainly not have been noticed if <i>any</i>
  omissions had <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>[305]</span>been made. And we know that every letter
  was removed from Shirburn Castle to Oxford.</p>

  <p>Two persons emerge from oblivion in this series of letters. The first
  is Michael Dary,<a name="NtA_560" href="#Nt_560"><sup>[560]</sup></a> an
  obscure mathematician, who was in correspondence with Newton and other
  stars. He was a gauger at Bristol, by the interest of Collins; afterwards
  a candidate for the mathematical school at Christ's Hospital, with a
  certificate from Newton: he was then a gunner in the Tower, and is lastly
  described by Wallis as "Mr. Dary, the tobacco-cutter, a knowing man in
  algebra." In 1674, Dary writes to Newton at Cambridge, as
  follows:&mdash;"Although I sent you three papers yesterday, I cannot
  refrain from sending you this. I have had fresh thoughts this morning."
  Two months afterwards poor Newton writes to Collins, "Mr. Dary is very
  solicitous about mathematics": but in spite of the persecution, he
  subscribes himself to Dary "your loving friend." Dary's <i>problem</i> is
  that of finding the rate of interest of an annuity of which the value and
  term are given. Dary's <i>theorem</i>, which he seems to have invented
  specially for the solution of his problem, though it is of wide range,
  can be exhibited to mathematical readers even in our columns. In modern
  language, it is that the limit of <span
  class="grk">&phi;</span><sup><i>n</i></sup><i>x</i>, when <i>n</i>
  increases without limit, is a solution of <span
  class="grk">&phi;</span><i>x</i> = <i>x</i>. We have mentioned the I.
  Newton to whom Dary looked up; we add a word about the one on whom he
  looked down. Dr. John Newton,<a name="NtA_561"
  href="#Nt_561"><sup>[561]</sup></a> a sedulous publisher of logarithms,
  tables of interest, etc., who began his career before Isaac Newton,
  sometimes puzzles those who do not know him, when described as I. Newton.
  The scientific world was of opinion that all that was valuable in one of
  his works was taken from Dary's private communications.</p>

<p><!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>[306]</span></p>

  <p>The second character above alluded to is one who carried mathematical
  researches a far greater length than Newton himself: the assistance which
  he rendered in this respect, even to Newton, has never been acknowledged
  in modern times: though the work before us shows that his contemporaries
  were fully aware of it, and never thought of concealing it. In his theory
  of gravitation, in which, so far as he went, we have every reason to
  believe he was prior to Newton, he did not extend his calculations to the
  distance of the moon; his views in this matter were purely terrestrial,
  and led him to charge according to weight. He was John Stiles, the London
  and Cambridge carrier: his name is a household word in the Macclesfield
  Letters, and is even enshrined in the depths of Birch's quartos. Dary
  informs Newton&mdash;let us do his memory this justice&mdash;that he had
  paid John Stiles for the carriage. At the time when the railroad to
  Cambridge was opened, a correspondent recommended the directors, in our
  columns, to call an engine by the name of John Stiles, and never to let
  that name go off the road. We do not know whether the advice was
  followed: if not, we repeat it.</p>

  <p>Little points of life and manners come out occasionally. Baker, the
  author of a work on algebra much esteemed at the time, wrote to Collins
  that their circumstances are alike, "having a just and equal number of
  chargeable olive-branches, and being in the same predicament and blessed
  condemnation with you, not more preaching than unpaid, and preaching the
  art of contentment to others, am forced to practise it." But the last
  sentence of his letter runs as follows: "I have sent by the bearer ...
  twenty shillings, as a token to you; desiring you to accept of it, as a
  small taste from Yours, Thos. Baker." In our day, men of a station to pay
  parish taxes do not offer their friends hard money to buy liquor. But
  Flamsteed<a name="NtA_562" href="#Nt_562"><sup>[562]</sup></a> writes to
  Collins as follows: "Last week he sent us down the counterpart, which
  <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page307"></a>[307]</span>my father has scaled, and I return up to
  you by the carrier, with 5<i>l.</i> to be paid to Mr. Leneve for the
  writing, I have added 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> over, which will pay the
  expenses and serve to drink, with him." This would seem as odd to us as
  it would have seemed thirty years ago that half-a-crown should pay
  carriage for a deed from Derby to London, and leave margin for a bottle
  of wine: in our day, the Post-office and the French treaty would just
  manage it between them. But Flamsteed does not limit his friend to one
  bottle; he adds, "If you expend more than the half-crown, I will make it
  good after Whitsuntide." Collins does not remember exactly where he had
  met James Gregory, and mentions two equally likely places thus: "Sir, it
  was once my good hap to meet with you in an alehouse or in Sion College."
  There is a little proof how universally the dinner-hour was twelve
  o'clock. Astronomers well know the method of finding time by equal
  altitudes of the sun before and after noon: Huyghens calls it "le moyen
  de deux égales hauteurs du soleil devant et après <i>dîner</i>."<a
  name="NtA_563" href="#Nt_563"><sup>[563]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is one mention of "Mr. Cocker,<a name="NtA_564"
  href="#Nt_564"><sup>[564]</sup></a> our famous English graver and writer,
  now a schoolmaster at Northampton." This is the true Cocker: his genuine
  works are specimens of writing, such as engraved copy-books, including
  some on arithmetic, with copper-plate questions and space for the
  working; also a book of forms for law-stationers, with specimens of legal
  handwriting. It is recorded somewhere that Cocker and another, whose name
  we forget, competed with the Italians in the beauty of their flourishes.
  This was his real fame: and in these matters he was great. The eighth
  edition of his book of law forms (1675), published shortly after Cocker's
  death, has a preface signed "J.&nbsp;H." This was John Hawkins, who became
  possessed of Cocker's papers&mdash;at least he said so&mdash;and <!--
  Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page308"></a>[308]</span>subsequently forged the famous
  Arithmetic,<a name="NtA_565" href="#Nt_565"><sup>[565]</sup></a> a second
  work on Decimal Arithmetic, and an English dictionary, all attributed to
  Cocker. The proofs of this are set out in De Morgan's <i>Arithmetical
  Books</i>. Among many other corroborative circumstances, the clumsy
  forger, after declaring that Cocker to his dying day resisted strong
  solicitation to publish his Arithmetic, makes him write in the preface
  <i>Ille ego qui quondam</i><a name="NtA_566"
  href="#Nt_566"><sup>[566]</sup></a> of this kind: "I have been
  instrumental to the benefit of many, by virtue of those useful arts,
  writing and engraving; and do <i>now</i>, with the same <i>wonted
  alacrity</i>, cast this my arithmetical mite into the public treasury."
  The book itself is not comparable in merit to at least half-a-dozen
  others. How then comes Cocker to be the impersonation of Arithmetic?
  Unless some one can show proof, which we have never found, that he was so
  before 1756, the matter is to be accounted for thus.</p>

  <p>Arthur Murphy,<a name="NtA_567" href="#Nt_567"><sup>[567]</sup></a>
  the dramatist, was by taste a man of letters, and ended by being the
  translator of Tacitus; though many do not know that the two are one. His
  friends had tried to make him a man of business; and no doubt he had been
  well plied with commercial arithmetic. His first dramatic performance,
  the farce of "The Apprentice," produced in 1756, is about an idle young
  man who must needs turn actor. Two of the best known books of the day in
  arithmetic were those of Cocker and Wingate.<a name="NtA_568"
  href="#Nt_568"><sup>[568]</sup></a> Murphy chooses <i>Wingate</i> to be
  the name of an old merchant who <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>[309]</span>delights in vulgar fractions, and
  <i>Cocker</i> to be his arithmetical catchword&mdash;"You read
  Shakespeare! get Cocker's Arithmetic! you may buy it for a shilling on
  any stall; best book that ever was wrote!" and so on. The farce became
  very popular, and, as we believe, was the means of elevating Cocker to
  his present pedestal, where Wingate would have been, if his name had had
  the droller sound of the two to English ears.</p>

  <p>A notoriety of an older day turns up, Major-General Lambert.<a
  name="NtA_569" href="#Nt_569"><sup>[569]</sup></a> The common story is
  that he was banished to Guernsey, where he passed thirty years in
  confinement, rearing and painting flowers. But Baker, in 1678, represents
  him as a prisoner at Plymouth, sending equations for solution as a
  challenge: probably his place of confinement was varied, and his
  occupation also.</p>

  <p>[General Lambert was removed to Plymouth, probably about 1668. His
  daughter captured the son of the Governor of Guernsey, who therefore
  probably was reckoned an unsafe custodier thenceforward; though he
  assured the king that he had turned the young couple out of doors, and
  had never given them a penny. Great importance was attached to Lambert's
  safe detention: probably the remaining republicans looked upon him as to
  be their next Cromwell, if such a thing were to be. There were standing
  orders to shoot him at once on the first appearance of any enemy before
  the island. See <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3d S. iv. 89.]</p>

  <p>Collins informs James Gregory that "some of the Royal Academy wrote
  over to Mr. Oldenburg, who was desired to impart the same to the Council
  of the Royal Society, that the French King was willing to allow pensions
  to one or two learned Englishmen, but they never made any answer <!--
  Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>[310]</span>to
  such a proposal." This was written in 1671, and the thing probably
  happened several years before. Mr. De Morgan communicated the account of
  the proposal to Lord Macaulay, who replied that he did not think that any
  Englishman <i>received</i> a literary pension from Louis; but that there
  is a curious letter, about 1664, from the French Ambassador, in which he
  says that he has, by his master's orders, been making inquiries as to the
  state of learning in England, and that he is sorry to find that the best
  writer is <i>the infamous Miltonus</i>. On two such independent
  testimonies it may be held proved that the French King had attempted to
  buy a little adherence from English literature and science; and the
  silent contempt of the Royal Society is an honorable fact in their
  history.</p>

  <p>Another little bit of politics is as follows. Oughtred is informed
  that "Mr. Foster,<a name="NtA_570" href="#Nt_570"><sup>[570]</sup></a>
  our Lecturer on Astronomy at Gresham College, is put out because he will
  not kneel down at the communion-table. A Scotsman [Mungo Murray], one
  that is <i>verbi bis minister</i>,<a name="NtA_571"
  href="#Nt_571"><sup>[571]</sup></a> is now lecturer in Mr. Foster's
  place." Ward in his work on the Gresham Professors,<a name="NtA_572"
  href="#Nt_572"><sup>[572]</sup></a> suppresses the reason, and the
  suppression lowers the character of his book. Foster was expelled in
  1636, and re-elected on a vacancy in 1641, when Puritanism had gained
  strength.</p>

  <p>The correspondence of Newton would require deeper sifting than could
  be given in such an article as the present. The first of the letters
  (1669) is curious, as presenting the <!-- Page 311 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>[311]</span>appearance of forms
  belonging to the great calculus which, in this paragraph, we ought to
  call that of fluxions. We find, of the date February 18, 1669-70, what we
  believe is the earliest manifestation of that morbid part of Newton's
  temperament which has been so variously represented. He had solved a
  problem&mdash;being that which we have called Dary's&mdash;on which he
  writes as follows: "The solution of the annuity problem, if it will be of
  any use, you have my leave to insert into the <i>Philosophical
  Transactions</i>, so it be without my name to it. For I see not what
  there is desirable in public esteem, were I able to acquire and maintain
  it. It would perhaps increase my acquaintance, the thing which I chiefly
  study to decline."</p>

  <p>Three letters touch upon "the experiment of glass rubbed to cause
  various motions in bits of paper underneath": they are supplements to the
  account given by Newton to the Royal Society, and printed by Birch. It
  was Newton, so far as appears, who added <i>glass</i> to the substances
  known to be electric. Soon afterwards we come to a little bit of the
  history of the appointment to the Mint. It has appeared from the
  researches of late years that Newton was long an aspirant for public
  employment: the only coolness which is known to have taken place between
  him and Charles Montague<a name="NtA_573"
  href="#Nt_573"><sup>[573]</sup></a> [Halifax] arose out of his imagining
  that his friend was not in earnest about getting him into the public
  service. March 14, 1696, Newton writes thus to Halley: "And if the rumour
  of preferment for me in the Mint should hereafter, upon the death of Mr.
  Hoar [the comptroller], or any other occasion, be revived, I pray that
  you would <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page312"></a>[312]</span>endeavour to obviate it by acquainting
  your friends that I neither <i>put in</i> for <i>any</i> place in the
  Mint, nor would meddle with <i>Mr. Hoar's place</i>, were it offered to
  me." This means that Mr. Hoar's place had been suggested, which Newton
  seems to have declined. Five days afterwards, Montague writes to Newton
  that he is to have the <i>Wardenship</i>. It is fair to Newton to say
  that in all probability this was not&mdash;or only in a smaller
  degree&mdash;a question of personal dignity, or of salary. It must by
  this time have been clear to him that the minister, though long bound to
  make him an object of patronage, was actually seeking him for the Mint,
  because he wanted both Newton's name and his talents for
  business&mdash;which he knew to be great&mdash;in the weighty and
  dangerous operation of restoring the coinage. It may have been, and
  probably was, the case that Newton had a tolerably accurate notion of
  what he would have to do, and of what degree of power would be necessary
  to enable him to do it in his own way.</p>

  <p>We have said that the non-epistolary manuscripts are still unexamined.
  There is a chance that one of them may answer a question of two
  centuries' standing, which is worth answering, because it has been so
  often asked. About 1640, Warner,<a name="NtA_574"
  href="#Nt_574"><sup>[574]</sup></a> afterwards assisted by Pell,<a
  name="NtA_575" href="#Nt_575"><sup>[575]</sup></a> commenced a table of
  <i>antilogarithms</i>, of the kind which Dodson<a name="NtA_576"
  href="#Nt_576"><sup>[576]</sup></a> afterwards constructed anew and
  published. In the Museum collection there is inquiry after inquiry from
  Charles Cavendish,<a name="NtA_577" href="#Nt_577"><sup>[577]</sup></a>
  first, as to when the <i>Analogics</i>, as he called them, would be
  finished; next, when they would be printed. Pell answers, in 1644, that
  Warner left his papers to a kinsman, who had become bankrupt, and
  proceeds thus:</p>

  <p>"I am not a little afraid that all Mr. Warner's papers, <!-- Page 313
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>[313]</span>and no small
  share of my labours therein, are seazed upon, and most unmathematically
  divided between the sequestrators and creditors, who (not being able to
  ballance the account where there appeare so many numbers, and much
  troubled at the sight of so many crosses and circles in the superstitious
  Algebra and that black art of Geometry) will, no doubt, determine once in
  their lives to become figure-casters, and so vote them all to be throwen
  into the fire, if some good body doe not reprieve them for pye-bottoms,
  for which purposes you know analogicall numbers are incomparably apt, if
  they be accurately calculated."</p>

  <p>Pell afterwards told Wallis<a name="NtA_578"
  href="#Nt_578"><sup>[578]</sup></a> that the papers had fallen into the
  hands of Dr. Busby,<a name="NtA_579" href="#Nt_579"><sup>[579]</sup></a>
  and Collins<a name="NtA_580" href="#Nt_580"><sup>[580]</sup></a> writes
  that they were left in the hands of Dr. Thorndike,<a name="NtA_581"
  href="#Nt_581"><sup>[581]</sup></a> a prebendary of Westminster; whence
  Rigaud<a name="NtA_582" href="#Nt_582"><sup>[582]</sup></a> seems to say
  that Thorndike had left them to Dr. Busby. Birch<a name="NtA_583"
  href="#Nt_583"><sup>[583]</sup></a> says that he procured for the Royal
  Society four boxes from Busby's trustees, containing papers of Warner and
  Pell: but there is no other tradition of such things in the Society. But
  in the Birch manuscripts at the British Museum, there turns up, as
  printed in what we call the Museum collection, a list of Warner's papers,
  with <i>Collins's</i> receipt to Dr. Thorndike at the bottom, and
  engagement to restore them on demand. The date is December 14, 1667;
  Wallis's statement being in 1693. It is possible that Busby may be a
  mistake altogether: he was very unlikely to have had charge of any
  mathematical papers: there may have been a confusion between the
  Prebendary of Westminster and the Head Master of Westminster School. If
  so, in all probability Thorndike handed <!-- Page 314 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>[314]</span>the cumbrous lot over
  to the notorious collector of mathematical papers, blessing himself that
  he got rid of them in a manner which would insure their return if he were
  called upon by the owners to restore them. It is much against this
  hypothesis that Dodson, who certainly recalculated, can say nothing more
  about Warner than a repetition of Wallis's story: though, had Collins
  kept the papers, they would probably have been in Jones's possession at
  the very time when Dodson, who was a friend of Jones and a user of his
  library, was engaged on his own computations. But even books, and still
  more manuscripts, are often singularly overlooked; and it remains not
  very improbable that Warner's table is now at Shirburn Castle, among the
  unexamined manuscripts.</p>

<p class="cenhead">CYCLOMETRY AND STEEL PENS.</p>

  <p><i>Redit labor actus in orbem.</i><a name="NtA_584"
  href="#Nt_584"><sup>[584]</sup></a> Among the matters which have come to
  me since the Budget opened, there is a pamphlet of quadrature of two
  pages and a half from Professor Recalcati,<a name="NtA_585"
  href="#Nt_585"><sup>[585]</sup></a> already mentioned. It ends with
  "Quelque objection qu'on fasse touchant les raisonnements ci-dessus on
  tombera toujours dans l'absurde."<a name="NtA_586"
  href="#Nt_586"><sup>[586]</sup></a> A civil engineer&mdash;so he
  says&mdash;has made the quadrature "no longer a problem, but an axiom."
  As follows: "Take the quadrant of a circle whose circumference is given,
  square the quadrant which gives the true square of the circle. Because 30
  ÷ 4 = 7.5 × 7.5 = 56.25 = the positive square of a circle whose
  circumference is 30." Brevity, the soul of wit, is the "wings of
  mighty-winds" to quadrature, and sends it "flying all abroad." A
  <i>surbodhicary</i>&mdash;something like M.A. or LL.D., I
  understand&mdash;at Calcutta, published in 1863 the division of an <!--
  Page 315 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>[315]</span>angle
  into any odd number of parts, demonstration and all in&mdash;when the
  diagram is omitted&mdash;one page, good-sized, well-leaded type, small
  duodecimo. But in the Preface he acknowledges "sheer inability" to
  execute his task. Mr. William Dean, of Todmorden, in 1863, announced
  3-9/64 as proved both practically and geometrically: he has been already
  mentioned anonymously. Next I have the tract of Don Juan Larriva,
  published at Leiria in 1856, and dedicated to Queen Victoria. Mr. W.
  Peters,<a name="NtA_587" href="#Nt_587"><sup>[587]</sup></a> already
  mentioned, who has for some months been circulating diagrams on a card,
  publishes (August, 1865) <i>The Circle Squared</i>. He agrees with the
  Archpriest of St. Vitus. He hints that a larger publication will depend
  partly on the support he receives, and partly on the castigation, for
  which last, of course, he looks to me. Cyclometers have their several
  styles of wit; so have anticyclometers too, for that matter. Mr. Peters
  will not allow me any extra-journal being: I am essentially a quotation
  from the <i>Athenæum</i>; "A. De Morgan" <i>et præterea nihil</i>.<a
  name="NtA_588" href="#Nt_588"><sup>[588]</sup></a> If he had to pay for
  keeping me set up, he would find out his mistake, and would be glad to
  compound handsomely for a stereotype. Next comes a magnificent sheet of
  pasteboard, printed on both sides. Having glanced at it and detected
  quadrature, I began methodically at the beginning&mdash;"By Royal
  Command," with the lion and unicorn, and all that comes between. Mercy on
  us! thought I to myself: has Her Majesty referred the question to the
  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, where all the great difficulties
  go now-a-days, and is this proclamation the result? On reading further I
  was relieved by finding that the first side is entirely an advertisement
  of Joseph Gillott's<a name="NtA_589" href="#Nt_589"><sup>[589]</sup></a>
  steel pens, with engraving of his <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>[316]</span>premises, and notice of
  novel application of his unrivalled machinery. The second side begins
  with "the circle rectified" by W.&nbsp;E. Walker,<a name="NtA_590"
  href="#Nt_590"><sup>[590]</sup></a> who finds <span
  class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3.141594789624155.... This is an off-shoot from
  an accurate geometrical rectification, on which is to be presumed Mr.
  Gillott's new machinery is founded. I have no doubt that Mr. Walker's
  error, which is only in the sixth place of decimals, will not hurt the
  pens, unless it be by the slightest possible increase of the tendency to
  open at the points. This arises from Mr. Walker having rectified above
  proof by .000002136034362....</p>

  <p>Lastly, I, even I myself, who have long felt that I was a quadrature
  below par, have solved the problem by means which, in the present state
  of the law of libel, I dare not divulge. But the result is permitted; and
  it goes far to explain all the discordances. The ratio of the
  circumference to the diameter is not always the same! Not that it varies
  with the radius; the geometers are right enough on that point: but it
  varies with the time, in a <span class="correction" title="text reads `maner'"
  >manner</span> depending upon the difference of the true longitudes of
  the Sun and Moon. A friend of mine&mdash;at least until he
  misbehaved&mdash;insisted on the mean right ascensions: but I served him
  as Abraham served his guest in Franklin's parable. The true formula is, A
  and <i>a</i> being the Sun's and Moon's longitudes,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="grk">&pi;</span> = 3-13/80 + 3/80 cos(A - <i>a</i>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. James Smith obtained his quadrature at full moon; the Archpriest
  of St. Vitus and some others at new moon. Until I can venture to publish
  the demonstration, I recommend the reader to do as I do, which is to
  adopt 3.14159..., and to think of the matter only at the two points of
  the lunar month at which it is correct. The <i>Nautical Almanac</i> will
  no doubt give these points in a short time: I am in correspondence with
  the Admiralty, with nothing <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page317"></a>[317]</span>to get over except what I must call a
  perverse notion on the part of the Superintendent of the <i>Almanac</i>,
  who suspects one correction depending on the Moon's latitude; and the
  Astronomer Royal leans towards another depending on the date of the
  Queen's accession. I have no patience with these men: what can the Moon's
  node of the Queen's reign possibly have to do with the ratio in question?
  But this is the way with all the regular men of science; Newton is to
  them etc. etc. etc. etc.</p>

  <p>The following method of finding the circumference of a circle (taken
  from a paper by Mr. S. Drach<a name="NtA_591"
  href="#Nt_591"><sup>[591]</sup></a> in the <i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Jan. 1863,
  Suppl.) is as accurate as the use of 3.14159265. From three diameters
  deduct 8-thousandths and 7-millionths of a diameter; to the result add
  five per cent. We have then not quite enough; but the shortcoming is at
  the rate of about an inch and a sixtieth of an inch in 14,000 miles.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">JACOB BEHMEN.</p>

  <p>Though I have met with nothing but a little tract from the school of
  Jacob Behmen<a name="NtA_592" href="#Nt_592"><sup>[592]</sup></a> (or
  Böhme; I keep to the old English version of his name), yet there has been
  more, and of a more recent date. I am told of an "Introduction to
  Theosophy [<i>Theo</i> private, I suppose, as in theological]; or, the
  Science of the Mystery of Christ," published in 1854, mostly from the
  writings of William Law<a name="NtA_593"
  href="#Nt_593"><sup>[593]</sup></a>: and also of a volume of 688 pages,
  of the same year, printed for private circulation, containing notes for a
  biography of William Law. The editor of the first work wishes to grow "a
  <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>[318]</span>generation of perfect Christians" by
  founding a Theosophic College, for which he requests the public to raise
  a hundred thousand pounds. There is a good account of Jacob Behmen in the
  <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>. The author mentions inaccurate accounts, one of
  which he quotes, as follows: "He derived all his mystical and rapturous
  doctrine from Wood's<a name="NtA_594" href="#Nt_594"><sup>[594]</sup></a>
  <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>, Vol. I, p. 610, and <i>Hist. et Antiq. Acad.
  Oxon.</i>, Vol. II, p. 308." On which the author remarks that Wood was
  born after Behmen's death. There must have been a few words which slipped
  out: what is meant is that Behmen "derived his doctrine from <i>Robert
  Fludd</i>,<a name="NtA_595" href="#Nt_595"><sup>[595]</sup></a> <i>for
  whom see</i> Wood's etc. etc." Even this is absurd enough: for Behmen
  began to publish in 1610, and Fludd in 1616. Fludd was a Rosicrucian, and
  a mystic of a different type from Behmen. I have some of his works, and
  could produce out of them paradoxes enough, according to our ways of
  thinking, to fit out a host. But the Rosicrucian system was a recognized
  school of its day, and Fludd, a man of great learning, had abettors
  enough in all which he advanced, and predecessors in most of it.</p>

  <p>[A Correspondent has recently sent a short summary of the claims of
  Jacob Behmen to rank higher than I have placed him. I shall gladly insert
  this summary in the book I contemplate, as a statement of what is said of
  Behmen far less liable to suspicion of exaggeration than anything I could
  write. I shall add a few extracts from Behmen himself, in support of his
  right to be in my list.]</p>

  <p>"<i>Jacob Behmen.</i>&mdash;That Prof. De Morgan classes Jacob Behmen
  among paradoxers can only be attributed to the fact of his being avowedly
  unacquainted with the writings <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page319"></a>[319]</span>of that author. Perhaps you may think a
  few words from one who knows them well of sufficient interest to the
  learned Professor, and your readers in general, to be worthy of space in
  your columns. The metaphysical system of Behmen&mdash;the most perfect
  and only true one&mdash;still awaits a qualified commentator. Behmen's
  countryman, Dionysius Andreas Freher,<a name="NtA_596"
  href="#Nt_596"><sup>[596]</sup></a> who spent the greater part of his
  life in this country, and whose exposition of Behmen exists only in MS.,
  filling many volumes, written in English, with the exception of two,
  written in German, with numerous beautiful, highly ingenious, and
  elaborate illustrations,&mdash;copies of some of which are in the British
  Museum, but all the originals of which are in the possession of the
  gentleman who is the editor of the two works alluded to by Professor De
  Morgan,&mdash;this Freher was the first to philosophically expound
  Behmen's system, which was afterwards, with the help of these MSS., as it
  were, popularized by William Law; but both Freher and Law confined
  themselves chiefly to its theological aspect. In Behmen, however, is to
  be found, not only the true ground of all theology, but also that of all
  physical science. He demonstrated with a fullness, accuracy, completeness
  and certainty that leave nothing to be desired, the innermost ground of
  Deity and Nature; and, confining myself to the latter, I can from my own
  knowledge assert, that in Behmen's writings is to be found the true and
  clear demonstration of every physical fact that has been discovered since
  his day. Thus, the science of electricity, which was not yet in existence
  when he wrote, is there anticipated; and not only does Behmen describe
  all the now known phenomena of that force, but he even gives us the
  origin, generation and birth of electricity itself. Again, positive
  evidence can be adduced that Newton derived all his knowledge of
  gravitation and its <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page320"></a>[320]</span>laws from Behmen, with whom gravitation or
  attraction is, and very properly so, as he shows us, the first of the
  seven properties of Nature. The theory defended by Mr. Grove,<a
  name="NtA_597" href="#Nt_597"><sup>[597]</sup></a> at the Nottingham
  meeting of last year, that all the apparently distinct causes of moral
  and physical phenomena are but so many manifestations of one central
  force, and that Continuity is the law of nature, is clearly laid down,
  and its truth demonstrated, by Behmen, as well as the distinction between
  spirit and matter, and that the moral and material world is pervaded by a
  sublime unity. And though all this was not admitted in Behmen's days,
  because science was not then sufficiently advanced to understand the deep
  sense of our author, many of his passages, then unintelligible, or
  apparently absurd, read by the light of the present age, are found to
  contain the positive enunciation of principles at whose discovery and
  establishment science has only just arrived by wearisome and painful
  investigations. Every new scientific discovery goes to prove his profound
  and intuitive insight into the most secret workings of nature; and if
  scientific men, instead of sharing the prejudice arising from ignorance
  of Behmen's system, would place themselves on the vantage ground it
  affords, they would at once find themselves on an eminence whence they
  could behold all the arcana of nature. Behmen's system, in fact, shows us
  the <i>inside</i> of things, while modern physical science is content
  with looking at the <i>outside</i>. Behmen traces back every outward
  manifestation or development to its one central root,&mdash;to that one
  central energy which, as yet, is only suspected; every link in the chain
  of his demonstration is perfect, and there is not one link wanting. He
  carries us from the out-births of the circumference, along the radius to
  the center, <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page321"></a>[321]</span>or point, and beyond that even to the
  zero, demonstrating the constitution of the zero, or nothing, with
  mathematical precision. C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;H."</p>

  <p>And so Behmen is no subject for the Budget! I waited until I should
  chance to light on one of his volumes, knowing that any volume would do,
  and almost any page. My first hap was on the second volume of the edition
  of 1664 (4to, published by M. Richardson) and opening near the beginning,
  a turn or two brought me to page 13, where I saw about <i>sulphur</i> and
  <i>mercurius</i> as follows:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"Thus SUL is the soul, in an herb it is the oil, and in man also,
  according to the spirit of <i>this</i> world in the third principle,
  which is continually generated out of the anguish of the will in the
  mind, and the Brimstone-worm is the Spirit, which hath the fire and
  <i>burneth</i>: PHUR is the sour wheel in itself which causeth that.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mercurius</i> comprehendeth all the four forms, even as the life
  springeth up, and yet hath not its dark beginning in the Center as the
  PHUR hath, but after the flash of fire, when the sour dark form is
  terrified, where the hardness is turned into pliant sharpness, and where
  the second will (<i>viz.</i> the will of nature, which is called the
  Anguish) ariseth, there Mercurius hath its original. For MER is the
  shivering wheel, very horrible, sharp, venomous, and hostile; which
  assimulateth it thus in the sourness in the flash of fire, where the sour
  wrathful life <i>ariseth</i>. The syllable CU is the pressing out, of the
  <i>Anxious</i> will of the mind, from Nature: which is climbing up, and
  <i>willeth</i> to be out aloft. RI is the comprehension of the flash of
  fire, which in MER giveth a clear sound and tune. For the flash maketh
  the tune, and it is the Salt-Spirit which <i>soundeth</i>, and its form
  (or quality) is gritty like sand, and herein arise noises, sounds and
  voices, and thus CU comprehendeth the flash, and so the pressure is as a
  <i>wind</i> which thrusteth, and giveth a spirit to the flash, so that it
  liveth and burneth. Thus the <!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page322"></a>[322]</span>syllable US is called the burning fire,
  which with the spirit continually driveth itself forth: and the syllable
  CU presseth continually upon the flash."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Shades of Tauler<a name="NtA_598" href="#Nt_598"><sup>[598]</sup></a>
  and Paracelsus,<a name="NtA_599" href="#Nt_599"><sup>[599]</sup></a> how
  strangely you do mix! Well may Hallam call Germany the native soil of
  Mysticism. Had Behmen been the least of a scholar, he would not have
  divided <i>sulph-ur</i> and <i>merc-ur-i-us</i> as he has done: and the
  inflexion <i>us</i>, that boy of all work, would have been rejected. I
  think it will be held that a writer from whom hundreds of pages like the
  above could be brought together, is fit for the Budget. If Sampson Arnold
  Mackay<a name="NtA_600" href="#Nt_600"><sup>[600]</sup></a> had tied his
  etymologies to a mystical Christology, instead of a mystical infidelity,
  he might have had a school of followers. The nonsense about Newton
  borrowing gravitation from Behmen passes only with those who know neither
  what Newton did, <span class="correction" title="text reads `not'"
  >nor</span> what was done before him.</p>

  <p>The above reminds me of a class of paradoxers whom I wonder that I
  forgot; they are without exception the greatest bores of all, because
  they can put the small end of their paradox into any literary
  conversation whatever. I mean the people who have heard the local
  pronunciation of celebrated names, and attempt not only to imitate it,
  but to impose on others their broken German or Arabic, or what not. They
  also learn the vernacular names of those who are generally spoken of in
  their Latin forms; at least, they learn a few cases, and hawk them as
  evidences of erudition. They are miserably mistaken: scholarship, as a
  rule, <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page323"></a>[323]</span>always accepts the vernacular form of a
  name which has vernacular celebrity. Hallam writes Behmen: his
  index-maker, rather superfluously, gives "<i>Behmen</i> or Boehm." And he
  retains Melanchthon,<a name="NtA_601" href="#Nt_601"><sup>[601]</sup></a>
  the name given by Reuchlin<a name="NtA_602"
  href="#Nt_602"><sup>[602]</sup></a> to his little kinsman Schwartzerd,
  because the world has adopted it: but he will none of Capnio, the name
  which Reuchlin fitted on to himself, because the world has not adopted
  it. He calls the old forms pedantry: but he sees that the rejection of
  well-established results of pedantry would be greater pedantry still. The
  paradoxers assume the question that it is more <i>correct</i> to sound a
  man by lame imitation of his own countrymen than as usual in the country
  in which the sound is to be made. Against them are, first, the world at
  large; next, an overpowering majority of those who know something about
  surnames and their history. Some thirty years ago&mdash;a
  fact&mdash;there appeared at the police-office a complainant who found
  his own law. In the course of his argument, he asked, "What does Kitty
  say?"&mdash;"Who's Kitty?" said the magistrate, "your wife, or your
  nurse?"&mdash;"Sir! I mean Kitty, the celebrated lawyer."&mdash;"Oh!"
  said the magistrate, "I suspect you mean Mr. Chitty,<a name="NtA_603"
  href="#Nt_603"><sup>[603]</sup></a> the author of the great work on
  pleading."&mdash;"I do sir! But Chitty is an Italian name, and ought to
  be pronounced <i>Kitty</i>." This man was a full-blown flower: but there
  is many a modest bud; and all ought either to blush when seen or to waste
  their pronunciation on the desert air.</p>

<p class="cenhead">A PLEA FOR KING CUSTOM.</p>

  <p>I stand up for King Custom, or <i>Usus</i>, as Horace called him, with
  whom is <i>arbitrium</i> the decision, and <i>jus</i> the right, and
  <i>norma</i> the way of deciding, simply because he has <i>potestas</i>
  the power. He may admit one and another principle to advise: but Custom
  is not a constitutional king; he may listen to his cabinet, but he
  decides for himself: and if the ministry should resign, he blesses his
  stars and does without them. We have a glorious liberty in England of
  owning neither dictionary, grammar, nor spelling-book: as many as choose
  write by either of the three, and decide all disputed points their own
  way, those following them who please.</p>

  <p>Throughout this book I have called people by the names which denote
  them in their books, or by our vernacular names. This is the intelligible
  way of proceeding. I might, for instance (Vol. I, p. 44), have spoken of
  Charles de Bovelles,<a name="NtA_604" href="#Nt_604"><sup>[604]</sup></a>
  of Lefèvre d'Étaples,<a name="NtA_605"
  href="#Nt_605"><sup>[605]</sup></a> of Pèlerin,<a name="NtA_606"
  href="#Nt_606"><sup>[606]</sup></a> and of Etienne.<a name="NtA_607"
  href="#Nt_607"><sup>[607]</sup></a> But I prefer the old plan. Those who
  like another plan better, are welcome to substitute with a pen, when they
  know what to write; when they do not, it is clear that they would not
  have understood me if I had given modern names.</p>

  <p>The principal advisers of King Custom are as follows. First, there is
  Etymology, the <i>chiffonnier</i>, or general rag-merchant, who has made
  such a fortune of late years in his own business that he begins to be
  considered highly respectable. He gives advice which is more thought of
  than followed, partly on account of the fearful extremes into which he
  runs. He lately asked some boys of sixteen, at a matriculation
  examination in <i>English</i>, to what branch of <!-- Page 325 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>[325]</span>the Indo-Germanic
  family they felt inclined to refer the Pushto language, and what changes
  in the force of the letters took place in passing from Greek into
  M&oelig;so-Gothic. Because all syllables were once words, he is a little
  inclined to insist that they shall be so still. He would gladly rule
  English with a Saxon rod, which might be permitted with a certain
  discretion which he has never attained: and when opposed, he defends
  himself with analogies of the Aryan family until those who hear him long
  for the discovery of an Athanasyus. He will transport a word beyond
  seas&mdash;he is recorder of Rhematopolis&mdash;on circumstantial
  evidence which looks like mystery gone mad; but, strange to say,
  something very often comes to light after sentence is passed which proves
  the soundness of the conviction.</p>

  <p>The next adviser is Logic, a swearing old justice of peace, quorum,
  and rotulorum, whose excesses brought on such a fit of the gout that for
  many years he was unable to move. He is now mending, and his friends say
  he has sown his wild oats. He has some influence with the educated
  subjects of Custom, and will have more, if he can learn the line at which
  interference ought to stop: with them he has succeeded in making an
  affirmative of two negatives; but the vulgar won't never have nothing to
  say to him. He has always railed at Milton for writing that Eve was the
  fairest of her daughters; but has never satisfactorily shown what Milton
  ought to have said instead.</p>

  <p>The third adviser has more influence with the mass of the subjects of
  King Custom than the other two put together; his name is Fiddlefaddle,
  the toy-shop keeper; and the other two put him forward to do their worst
  work. In return, he often uses their names without authority. He took
  Etymology to witness that <i>means</i> to an end must be plural: and he
  would have any one method to be a <i>mean</i>. But Etymology proved him
  wrong, King Custom referred him to his Catechism, in which is "a means
  whereby we receive the same," and Analogy&mdash;a subordinate of <!--
  Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page326"></a>[326]</span>Etymology&mdash;asked whether he thought
  it a great <i>new</i> to hear that he was wrong. It was either this
  Fiddlefaddle, or Lindley Murray<a name="NtA_608"
  href="#Nt_608"><sup>[608]</sup></a> his traveler, who persuaded the Miss
  Slipslops, of the Ladies Seminary, to put "The Misses Slipslop" over the
  gate. Sixty years ago, this bagman called at all the girls' schools, and
  got many of the teachers to insist on the pupils saying "Is it not" and
  "Can I not" for "Isn't it" and "Can't I": of which it came that the poor
  girls were dreadfully laughed at by their irreverent brothers when they
  went home for the holidays. Had this bad adviser not been severely
  checked, he might by this time have proposed our saying "The Queen's of
  England son," declaring, in the name of Logic, that the prince was the
  Queen's son, not England's.</p>

  <p>Lastly, there is Typography the metallurgist, an executive officer who
  is always at work in secret, and whose lawless mode of advising is often
  done by carrying his notions into effect without leave given. He it is
  who never ceases suggesting that the same word is not to occur in a
  second place within sight of the first. When the Authorized Version was
  first printed, he began this trick at the passage, "Let there be light,
  and there was light;" he drew a line on the proof under the second
  <i>light</i>, and wrote "<i>luminosity?</i>" opposite. He is strongest in
  the punctuations and other signs; he has a pepper-box full of commas
  always by his side. He puts everything under marks of quotation which he
  has ever heard before. An earnest preacher, in a very moving sermon, used
  the phrase Alas! and alack a day! Typography stuck up the inverted commas
  because he had read the old Anglo-Indian toast, "A lass and a lac a day!"
  If any one should have the sense to leave out of his Greek <!-- Page 327
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>[327]</span>the unmeaning
  scratches which they call accents, he goes to a lexicon and puts them in.
  He is powerful in routine; but when two routines interlace or overlap, he
  frequently takes the wrong one.</p>

  <p>Subject to bad advice, and sometimes misled for a season, King Custom
  goes on his quiet way and is sure to be right at last.</p>

  <p>Language is in constant fermentation, and all that is thrown in, so
  far as it is not fit to assimilate, is thrown off; and this without any
  obvious struggle. In the meanwhile every one who has read good authors,
  from Shakspeare downward, knows what is and what is not English; and
  knows, also, that our language is not one and indivisible. Two very
  different turns of phrase may both be equally good, and as good as can
  be: we may be relieved of the consequences of contempt of one court by
  <i>habeas corpus</i> issuing out of another.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">TEST OF LANGUAGE.</p>

  <p>Hallam remarks that the Authorized Version of the Bible is not in the
  language of the time of James the First: that it is not the English of
  Raleigh or of Bacon. Here arises the question whether Raleigh and Bacon
  are the true expositors of the language of their time; and whether they
  were not rather the incipient promoters of a change which was
  successfully resisted by&mdash;among other things&mdash;the Authorized
  Version of the Testaments. I am not prepared to concede that I should
  have given to the English which would have been fashioned upon that of
  Bacon by imitators, such as they usually are, the admiration which is
  forced from me by Bacon's English from Bacon's pen. On this point we have
  a notable parallel. Samuel Johnson <!-- Page 328 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>[328]</span>commands our
  admiration, at least in his matured style: but we nauseate his followers.
  It is an opinion of mine that the works of the leading writers of an age
  are seldom the proper specimens of the language of their day, when that
  language is in its state of progression. I judge of a language by the
  colloquial idiom of educated men: that is, I take this to be the best
  medium between the extreme cases of one who is ignorant of grammar and
  one who is perched upon a style. Dialogue is what I want to judge by, and
  plain dialogue: so I choose Robert Recorde<a name="NtA_609"
  href="#Nt_609"><sup>[609]</sup></a> and his pupil in the <i>Castle of
  Knowledge</i>, written before 1556. When Dr. Robert gets into his
  altitudes of instruction, he differs from his own common phraseology as
  much as probably did Bacon when he wrote morals and philosophy. But every
  now and then I come to a little plain talk about a common thing, of which
  I propose to show a specimen. Anything can be made to look old by such
  changes as <i>makes</i> into <i>maketh</i>, with a little old spelling. I
  shall invert these changes, using the newer form of inflexion, and the
  modern spelling: with no other variation whatever.</p>

  <p>"<i>Scholar.</i> Yet the reason of that is easy enough to be
  conceived, for when the day is at the longest the Sun must needs shine
  the more time, and so must it needs shine the less time when the day is
  at the shortest: this reason I have heard many men declare.</p>

  <p><i>Master.</i> That may be called a crabbed reason, for it <!-- Page
  329 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>[329]</span>goes
  backward like a crab. The day makes not the Sun to shine, but the Sun
  shining makes the day. And so the length of the day makes not the Sun to
  shine long, neither the shortness of the day causes not [<i>sic</i>] the
  Sun to shine the lesser time, but contrariwise the long shining of the
  Sun makes the long day, and the short shining of the Sun makes the lesser
  day: else answer me what makes the days long or short?</p>

  <p><i>Scholar.</i> I have heard wise men say that Summer makes the long
  days, and Winter makes the long nights.</p>

  <p><i>Master.</i> They might have said more wisely, that long days make
  summer and short days make winter.</p>

  <p><i>Scholar.</i> Why, all that seems one thing to me.</p>

  <p><i>Master.</i> Is it all one to say, God made the earth, and the earth
  made God? Covetousness overcomes all men, and all men overcome
  covetousness?</p>

  <p><i>Scholar.</i> No, not so; for here the effect is turned to be the
  cause, and the agent is made the patient.</p>

  <p><i>Master.</i> So is it to say Summer makes long days, when you should
  say: Long days make summer.</p>

  <p><i>Scholar.</i> I perceive it now: but I was so blinded with the
  vulgar error, that if you had demanded of me further what did make the
  summer, I had been like to have answered that green leaves do make
  summer; and the sooner by remembrance of an old saying that a year should
  come in which the summer should not be known but by the green leaves.</p>

  <p><i>Master.</i> Yet this saying does not import that green leaves do
  make summer, but that they betoken summer; so are they the sign and not
  the cause of summer."</p>

  <p>I have taken a whole page of our author, without omission, that the
  reader may see that I do not pick out sentences convenient for my
  purpose. I have done nothing but alter the third person of the verb and
  the spelling: but great is the effect thereof. We say "the Sun shining
  makes the day"; Recorde, "the Sonne shynynge maketh the daye." <!-- Page
  330 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>[330]</span>These
  points apart, we see a resemblance between our English and that of three
  hundred years ago, in the common talk of educated persons, which will
  allow us to affirm that the language of the authorized Bible must have
  been very close to that of its time. For I cannot admit that much change
  can have taken place in fifty years: and the language of the version
  represents both our common English and that of Recorde with very close
  approximation. Take sentences from Bacon and Raleigh, and it will be
  apparent that these writers will be held to differ from all three,
  Recorde, the version, and ourselves, by differences of the same
  character. But we speak of Recorde's conversation, and of our own. We
  conclude that it is the plain and almost colloquial character of the
  Authorized Version which distinguishes it from the English of Bacon and
  Raleigh, by approximating it to the common idiom of the time. If any one
  will cast an eye upon the letters of instruction written by Cecil<a
  name="NtA_610" href="#Nt_610"><sup>[610]</sup></a> and the Bishop of
  London to the translators themselves, or to the general directions sent
  to them in the King's name, he will find that these plain business
  compositions differ from the English of Bacon and Raleigh by the same
  sort of differences which distinguish the version itself.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">PRONUNCIATION.</p>

  <p>The foreign word, or the word of a district, or class of people,
  passes into the general vernacular; but it is long before the specially
  learned will acknowledge the right of those with whom they come in
  contact to follow general usage. The rule is simple: so long as a word is
  technical or local, those who know its technical or local pronunciation
  may reasonably employ it. But when the word has become general, the
  specialist is not very wise if he refuse to follow <!-- Page 331 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>[331]</span>the mass, and perfectly
  foolish if he insist on others following him. There have been a few who
  demanded that Euler should be pronounced in the German fashion:<a
  name="NtA_611" href="#Nt_611"><sup>[611]</sup></a> Euler has long been
  the property of the world at large; what does it matter how his own
  countrymen pronounce the letters? Shall we insist on the French
  pronouncing <i>Newton</i> without that final <i>tong</i> which they never
  fail to give him? They would be wise enough to laugh at us if we did. We
  remember that a pedant who was insisting on all the pronunciations being
  retained, was met by a maxim in contradiction, invented at the moment,
  and fathered upon Kaen-foo-tzee,<a name="NtA_612"
  href="#Nt_612"><sup>[612]</sup></a> an authority which he was challenged
  to dispute. Whom did you speak of? said the bewildered man of accuracy.
  Learn your own system, was the answer, before you impose it on others;
  Confucius says that too.<a name="NtA_613"
  href="#Nt_613"><sup>[613]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The old English has <i>fote</i>, <i>fode</i>, <i>loke</i>,
  <i>coke</i>, <i>roke</i>, etc., for <i>foot</i>, etc. And <i>above</i>
  rhymes in Chaucer to <i>remove</i>. Suspecting that the broader sounds
  are the older, we may surmise that <i>remove</i> and <i>food</i> have
  retained their old sounds, and that <i>cook</i>, once <i>coke</i>, would
  have rhymed to our <i>Luke</i>, the vowel being brought a little nearer,
  perhaps, to the <i>o</i> in our present <i>coke</i>, the fuel, probably
  so called as used by cooks. If this be so, the Chief Justice
  <i>Cook</i><a name="NtA_614" href="#Nt_614"><sup>[614]</sup></a> of our
  lawyers, and the <i>Coke</i> (pronounced like the fuel) of the greater
  part of the world, are equally wrong. The lawyer has no right whatever to
  fasten his pronunciation upon us: even leaving aside the general custom,
  he cannot prove himself right, and is probably wrong. Those who <!-- Page
  332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>[332]</span>know the
  village of Rokeby (pronounced Rookby) despise the world for not knowing
  how to name Walter Scott's poem: that same world never asked a question
  about the matter, and the reception of the parody of <i>Jokeby</i>, which
  soon appeared, was a sufficient indication of their notion. Those who
  would fasten the hodiernal sound upon us may be reminded that the
  question is, not what they call it now, but what it was called in
  Cromwell's time. Throw away general usage as a lawgiver, and this is the
  point which emerges. Probably <i>R&#x16B;ke-by</i> would be right, with a
  little turning of the Italian &#x16B; towards &#x14D; of modern
  English.</p>

  <p>[Some of the above is from an old review. I do not always notice such
  insertions: I take nothing but my own writings. A friend once said to me,
  "Ah! you got that out of the <i>Athenæum</i>!" "Excuse me," said I. "the
  <i>Athenæum</i> got that out of me!"]</p>

<p class="cenhead">APOLOGIES TO CLUVIER.</p>

  <p>It is part of my function to do justice to any cyclometers whose
  methods have been wrongly described by any orthodox sneerers (myself
  included). In this character I must notice <i>Dethlevus Cluverius</i>,<a
  name="NtA_615" href="#Nt_615"><sup>[615]</sup></a> as the Leipzig Acts
  call him (probably Dethleu Cluvier), grandson of the celebrated
  geographer, Philip Cluvier. The grandson was a Fellow of the Royal
  Society, elected on the same day as Halley,<a name="NtA_616"
  href="#Nt_616"><sup>[616]</sup></a> November 30, 1678: I suppose he lived
  in England. This <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>[333]</span>man is quizzed in the Leipzig Acts for
  1686; and, if Montucla insinuate rightly, by Leibnitz, who is further
  suspected of wanting to embroil Cluvier with his own opponent
  Nieuwentiit,<a name="NtA_617" href="#Nt_617"><sup>[617]</sup></a> on the
  matter of infinitesimals. So far good: I have nothing against Leibnitz,
  who though he was ironical, told us what he laughed at. But Montucla has
  behaved very unfairly: he represents Cluvier as placing the essence of
  his method in the solution of the problem <i>construere mundum divinæ
  menti analogum</i>, to construct a world corresponding to the divine
  mind. Nothing to begin with: no way of proceeding. Now, it ought to have
  been <i>ex data linea construere</i>,<a name="NtA_618"
  href="#Nt_618"><sup>[618]</sup></a> etc.: there is a given line, which is
  something to go on. Further, there is a way of proceeding: it is to find
  the product of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. for ever. Moreover, Montucla charges
  Cluvier with <i>unsquaring</i> the parabola, which Archimedes had squared
  as tight as a glove. But he never mentions how very nearly Cluvier agrees
  with the Greek: they only differ by 1 divided by 3<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>,
  where <i>n</i> is the infinite number of parts of which a parabola is
  composed. This must have been the conceit that tickled Leibnitz, and made
  him wish that Cluvier and Nieuwentiit should fight it out. Cluvier, was
  admitted, on terms of irony, into the Leipzig Acts: he appeared on a more
  serious footing in London. It is very rare for one cyclometer to refute
  another: <i>les corsaires ne se battent pas</i>.<a name="NtA_619"
  href="#Nt_619"><sup>[619]</sup></a> The only instance I recall is that of
  M. Cluvier, who (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1686, No. 185) refuted M. Mallemont
  de Messange,<a name="NtA_620" href="#Nt_620"><sup>[620]</sup></a> who
  <!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page334"></a>[334]</span>published at Paris in 1686. He does it in
  a very serious style, and shows himself a mathematician. And yet in the
  year in which, in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, he was a geometer, and one who
  rebukes his squarer for quoting Matthew xi. 25, in that very year he was
  the visionary who, in the Leipzig Acts, professed to build a world
  resembling the divine mind by multiplying together 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. up to
  infinity.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE RAINBOW PARADOX.</p>

  <p>There is a very pretty opening for a paradox which has never found its
  paradoxer in print. The philosophers teach that the rainbow is not
  material: it comes from rain-drops, but those rain-drops do not
  <i>take</i> color. They only <i>give</i> it, as lenses and mirrors; and
  each one drop gives <i>all</i> the colors, but throws them in different
  directions. Accordingly, the same drop which furnishes red light to one
  spectator will furnish violet to another, properly placed. Enter the
  paradoxer whom I have to invent. The philosopher has gulled you nicely.
  Look into the water, and you will see the reflected rainbow: take a
  looking-glass held sideways, and you see another reflection. How could
  this be, if there were nothing colored to reflect? The paradoxer's facts
  are true: and what are called the reflected rainbows are <i>other</i>
  rainbows, caused by those <i>other</i> drops which are placed so as to
  give the colors to the eye after reflection, at the water or the
  looking-glass. A few years ago an artist exhibited a picture with a
  rainbow and its apparent reflection: he simply copied what he had seen.
  When his picture was examined, some started the idea that there could be
  no reflection of a rainbow; they were right: they inferred that the
  artist had made a mistake; they were wrong. When it was explained, some
  agreed and some dissented. Wanted, <!-- Page 335 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>[335]</span>immediately, an able
  paradoxer: testimonials to be forwarded to either end of the rainbow, No.
  1. No circle-squarer need apply, His Variegatedness having been pleased
  to adopt 3.14159... from Noah downwards.</p>

  <p>The system of Tycho Brahé,<a name="NtA_621"
  href="#Nt_621"><sup>[621]</sup></a> with some alteration and addition,
  has been revived and contended for in our own day by a Dane, W.
  Zytphen,<a name="NtA_622" href="#Nt_622"><sup>[622]</sup></a> who has
  published <i>The Motion of the Sun in the Universe</i>, (second edition)
  Copenhagen, 1865, 8vo, and <i>Le Mouvement Sidéral</i>, 1865, 8vo. I make
  an extract.</p>

  <p>"How can one explain Copernically that the velocity of the Moon must
  be added to the velocity of the Earth on the one place in the Earth's
  orbit, to learn how far the Moon has advanced from one fixed star to
  another; but in another place in the orbit these velocities must be
  subtracted (the movements taking place in opposite directions) to attain
  the same result? In the Copernican and other systems, it is well known
  that the Moon, abstracting from the insignificant excentricity of the
  orbit, always in twenty-four hours performs an equally long distance. Why
  has Copernicus never been denominated Fundamentus or Fundator? Because he
  has never convinced anybody so thoroughly that this otherwise so natural
  epithet has occurred to the mind."</p>

  <p>Really the second question is more effective against Newton than
  against Copernicus; for it upsets gravity: the first is of great
  depth.</p>

<p class="cenhead">JAMES SMITH WILL NOT DOWN.</p>

  <p>The <i>Correspondent</i> journal makes a little episode in the history
  of my Budget (born May, 1865, died April, 1866). It consisted entirely of
  letters written by correspondents. In August, a correspondent who signed
  "Fair Play"&mdash;and who I was afterwards told was a lady&mdash;thought
  it would be a good joke to bring in the Cyclometers. Accordingly a letter
  was written, complaining that though Mr. Sylvester's<a name="NtA_623"
  href="#Nt_623"><sup>[623]</sup></a> demonstration of Newton's
  theorem&mdash;then attracting public attention&mdash;was duly lauded, the
  possibly greater discovery of the quadrature seemed to be blushing
  unseen, and wasting etc. It went on as follows:</p>

  <p>"Prof. De Morgan, who, from his position in the scientific world,
  might fairly afford to look favourably on less practised efforts than his
  own, seems to delight in ridiculing the discoverer. Science is, of
  course, a very respectable person when he comes out and makes himself
  useful in the world [it must have been a lady; each sex gives science to
  the other]: but when, like a monk of the Middle Ages, he shuts himself up
  [it must have been a lady; they always snub the bachelors] in his
  cloistered cell, repeating his mumpsimus from day to day, and despising
  the labourers on the outside, we begin to think of Galileo,<a
  name="NtA_624" href="#Nt_624"><sup>[624]</sup></a> Jenner,<a
  name="NtA_625" href="#Nt_625"><sup>[625]</sup></a> Harvey,<a
  name="NtA_626" href="#Nt_626"><sup>[626]</sup></a> and other glorious
  trios, who have been contemned ..."</p>

  <p>The writer then called upon Mr. James Smith<a name="NtA_627"
  href="#Nt_627"><sup>[627]</sup></a> to come <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>[337]</span>forward. The irony was
  not seen; and that day fortnight appeared the first of more than thirty
  letters from his pen. Mr. Smith was followed by Mr. Reddie,<a
  name="NtA_628" href="#Nt_628"><sup>[628]</sup></a> Zadkiel,<a
  name="NtA_629" href="#Nt_629"><sup>[629]</sup></a> and others, on their
  several subjects. To some of the letters I have referred; to others I
  shall come. The <i>Correspondent</i> was to become a first-class
  scientific journal; the time had arrived at which truth had an organ: and
  I received formal notice that I could not stifle it by silence, nor
  convert it into falsehood by ridicule. When my reader sees my extracts,
  he will readily believe my declaration that I should have been the last
  to stifle a publication which was every week what James Mill<a
  name="NtA_630" href="#Nt_630"><sup>[630]</sup></a> would call a dose of
  capital for my Budget. A few anti-paradoxers brought in common sense: but
  to the mass of the readers of the journal it all seemed to be the
  difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Some said that the influx
  of scientific paradoxes killed the journal: but my belief is that they
  made it last longer than it otherwise would have done. Twenty years ago I
  recommended the paradoxers to combine and publish their views in a common
  journal: with a catholic editor, who had no pet theory, but a stern
  determination not to exclude anything merely for absurdity. I suspect it
  would answer very well. A strong title, or motto, would be wanted: not so
  coarse as was roared out in a Cambridge mob when I was an
  undergraduate&mdash;"No King! No Church! No House of Lords! No nothing,
  blast me!"&mdash;but something on that <i>principle</i>.</p>

  <p>At the end of 1867 I addressed the following letter to the
  <i>Athenæum</i>:</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Pseudomath, Philomath, and Graphomath.</span></p>

  <p class="author"><i>December 31, 1867</i></p>

  <p>Many thanks for the present of Mr. James Smith's letters <!-- Page 338
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>[338]</span>of Sept. 28
  and of Oct. 10 and 12. He asks where you will be if you read and digest
  his letters: you probably will be somewhere first. He afterwards asks
  what the <span class="scac">WE</span> of the <i>Athenæum</i> will be if,
  finding it impossible to controvert, it should refuse to print. I answer
  for you, that We-We of the <i>Athenæum</i>, not being Wa-Wa the wild
  goose, so conspicuous in "Hiawatha," will leave what controverts itself
  to print itself, if it please.</p>

  <p><i>Philomath</i> is a good old word, easier to write and speak than
  <i>mathematician</i>. It wants the words between which I have placed it.
  They are not well formed: <i>pseudomathete</i> and <i>graphomathete</i>
  would be better: but they will do. I give an instance of each.</p>

  <p>The <i>pseudomath</i> is a person who handles mathematics as the
  monkey handled the razor. The creature tried to shave himself as he had
  seen his master do; but, not having any notion of the angle at which the
  razor was to be held, he cut his own throat. He never tried a second
  time, poor animal! but the pseudomath keeps on at his work, proclaims
  himself clean-shaved, and all the rest of the world hairy. So great is
  the difference between moral and physical phenomena! Mr. James Smith is,
  beyond doubt, the great pseudomath of our time. His 3&#x215B; is the
  least of a wonderful chain of discoveries. His books, like Whitbread's
  barrels, will one day reach from Simpkin &amp; Marshall's to Kew, placed
  upright, or to Windsor laid length-ways. The Queen will run away on their
  near approach, as Bishop Hatto did from the rats: but Mr. James Smith
  will follow her were it to John o' Groats.</p>

  <p>The <i>philomath</i>, for my present purpose, must be exhibited as
  giving a lesson to presumption. The following anecdote is found in
  Thiébault's<a name="NtA_631" href="#Nt_631"><sup>[631]</sup></a>
  <i>Souvenirs de vingt ans de séjours à Berlin</i>, published in 1804. The
  book itself got a high character for truth. In 1807 Marshal Mollendorff<a
  name="NtA_632" href="#Nt_632"><sup>[632]</sup></a> <!-- Page 339 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>[339]</span>answered an inquiry of
  the Duc de Bassano,<a name="NtA_633" href="#Nt_633"><sup>[633]</sup></a>
  by saying that it was the most veracious of books, written by the most
  honest of men. Thiébault does not claim personal knowledge of the
  anecdote, but he vouches for its being received as true all over the
  north of Europe.<a name="NtA_634" href="#Nt_634"><sup>[634]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Diderot<a name="NtA_635" href="#Nt_635"><sup>[635]</sup></a> paid a
  visit to Russia at the invitation of Catherine the Second. At that time
  he was an atheist, or at least talked atheism: it would be easy to prove
  him either one thing or the other from his writings. His lively sallies
  on this subject much amused the Empress, and all the younger part of her
  Court. But some of the older courtiers suggested that it was hardly
  prudent to allow such unreserved exhibitions. The Empress thought so too,
  but did not like to muzzle her guest by an express prohibition: so a plot
  was contrived. The scorner was informed that an eminent mathematician had
  an algebraical proof of the existence of God, which he would communicate
  before the whole Court, if agreeable. Diderot gladly consented. The
  mathematician, who is not named, was Euler.<a name="NtA_636"
  href="#Nt_636"><sup>[636]</sup></a> He came to Diderot with the gravest
  air, and in a tone of perfect conviction said, "<i>Monsieur!</i></p>

<table class="math"><tr><td>
<i>a</i> + <i>b<sup>n</sup></i><br /><img src="images/$line.png" style="width:100%; height:1px; line-height:1px;" alt="/" /><br /><i>n</i> </td><td> = <i>x</i>
</td></tr></table>

  <p><i>donc Dieu existe; répondez!</i>"<a name="NtA_637"
  href="#Nt_637"><sup>[637]</sup></a> Diderot, to whom algebra was Hebrew,
  though this is expressed in a very roundabout way by Thiébault&mdash;and
  whom we may suppose to have expected some verbal argument of alleged
  algebraical closeness, was disconcerted; while peals of laughter sounded
  on all sides. Next day he asked permission to return to France, which was
  granted. An algebraist would have <!-- Page 340 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>[340]</span>turned the tables
  completely, by saying, "Monsieur! vous savez bien que votre raisonnement
  demande le développement de <i>x</i> suivant les puissances entières de
  <i>n</i>".<a name="NtA_638" href="#Nt_638"><sup>[638]</sup></a> Goldsmith
  could not have seen the anecdote, or he might have been supposed to have
  drawn from it a hint as to the way in which the Squire demolished poor
  Moses.</p>

  <p>The <i>graphomath</i> is a person who, having no mathematics, attempts
  to describe a mathematician. Novelists perform in this way: even Walter
  Scott now and then burns his fingers. His dreaming calculator, Davy
  Ramsay, swears "by the bones of the immortal Napier." Scott thought that
  the the philomaths worshiped relics: so they do, in one sense. Look into
  Hutton's<a name="NtA_639" href="#Nt_639"><sup>[639]</sup></a> Dictionary
  for <i>Napier's Bones</i>, and you shall learn all about the little
  knick-knacks by which he did multiplication and division. But never a
  bone of his own did he contribute; he preferred elephants' tusks. The
  author of <i>Headlong Hall</i><a name="NtA_640"
  href="#Nt_640"><sup>[640]</sup></a> makes a grand error, which is quite
  high science: he says that Laplace proved the precession of the equinoxes
  to be a periodical inequality. He should have said the variation of the
  obliquity. But the finest instance is the following: Mr. Warren,<a
  name="NtA_641" href="#Nt_641"><sup>[641]</sup></a> in his well-wrought
  tale of the martyr-philosopher, was incautious enough to invent the
  symbols by which his <i>savant</i> satisfied himself Laplace<a
  name="NtA_642" href="#Nt_642"><sup>[642]</sup></a> was right on a
  doubtful point. And this is what he put together&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&radic;-3<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>, <a href="images/bp2rectangle.png"><img src="images/bp2rectangle.png" class="middle" style="height:1ex" alt="rectangle" /></a><i>y</i><sup>2</sup> / <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> + 9 - <i>n</i> = 9, <i>n</i> × log <i>e</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now, to Diderot and the mass of mankind this might be Laplace all
  over: and, in a forged note of Pascal, would <!-- Page 341 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>[341]</span>prove him quite up to
  gravitation. But I know of nothing like it, except in the lately received
  story of the American orator, who was called on for some Latin, and
  perorated thus: "Committing the destiny of the country to your hands,
  Gentlemen, I may without fear declare, in the language of the noble Roman
  poet,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>E pluribus unum,</p>
      <p>Multum in parvo,</p>
      <p>Ultima Thule,</p>
      <p>Sine qua non."<a name="NtA_643" href="#Nt_643"><sup>[643]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But the American got nearer to Horace than the martyr-philosopher to
  Laplace. For all the words are in Horace, except <i>Thule</i>, which
  might have been there. But <a href="images/bp2rectangle.png"><img
  src="images/bp2rectangle.png" class="middle" style="height:1ex"
  alt="rectangle" /></a> is not a symbol wanted by Laplace; nor can we see
  how it could have been; in fact, it is not recognized in algebra. As to
  the junctions, etc., Laplace and Horace are about equally well
  imitated.</p>

  <p>Further thanks for Mr. Smith's letters to you of Oct. 15, 18, 19, 28,
  and Nov. 4, 15. The last of these letters has two curious discoveries.
  First, Mr. Smith declares that he has <i>seen</i> the editor of the
  <i>Athenæum</i>: in several previous letters he mentions a name. If he
  knew a little of journalism he would be aware that editors are a peculiar
  race, obtained by natural selection. They are never seen, even by their
  officials; only heard down a pipe. Secondly, "an ellipse or oval" is
  composed of four arcs of circles. Mr. Smith has got hold of the
  construction I was taught, when a boy, for a pretty four-arc oval. But my
  teachers knew better than to call it an ellipse: Mr. Smith does not; but
  he produces from it such confirmation of 3&#x215B; as would convince any
  <i>honest</i> editor.</p>

  <p>Surely the cyclometer is a Darwinite development of a spider, who is
  always at circles, and always begins again when his web is brushed away.
  He informs you that he <!-- Page 342 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page342"></a>[342]</span>has been privileged to discover truths
  unknown to the scientific world. This we know; but he proceeds to show
  that he is equally fortunate in art. He goes on to say that he will make
  use of you to bring those truths to light, "just as an artist makes use
  of a dummy for the purpose of arranging his drapery." The painter's
  lay-figure is for flowing robes; the hairdresser's dummy is for curly
  locks. Mr. James Smith should read Sam Weller's pathetic story of the
  "four wax dummies." As to <i>his</i> use of a dummy, it is quite correct.
  When I was at University College, I walked one day into a room in which
  my Latin colleague was examining. One of the questions was, "Give the
  lives and fates of Sp. Mælius,<a name="NtA_644"
  href="#Nt_644"><sup>[644]</sup></a> and Sp. Cassius."<a name="NtA_645"
  href="#Nt_645"><sup>[645]</sup></a> Umph! said I, surely all know that
  Spurius Mælius was whipped for adulterating flour, and that Spurius
  Cassius was hanged for passing bad money. Now, a robe arranged on a dummy
  would look just like the toga of Cassius on the gallows. Accordingly, Mr.
  Smith is right in the drapery-hanger which he has chosen: he has been
  detected in the attempt to pass bad circles. He complains bitterly that
  his geometry, instead of being read and understood by you, is handed over
  to me to be treated after my scurrilous fashion. It is clear enough that
  he would rather be handled in this way than not handled at all, or why
  does he go on writing? He must know by this time that it is a part of the
  institution that his "untruthful and absurd trash" shall be distilled
  into mine at the rate of about 3&#x215B; pages of the first to one column
  of the second. Your readers will never know how much they gain by the
  process, until Mr. James Smith publishes it all in a big book, or until
  they get hold of what he has already published. I have six pounds
  avoirdupois of pamphlets and letters; and there is more than half a pound
  of letters <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page343"></a>[343]</span>written to you in the last two months.
  Your compositor must feel aggrieved by the rejection of these clearly
  written documents, without erasures, and on one side only. Your
  correspondent has all the makings of a good contributor, except the
  knowledge of his subject and the sense to get it. He is, in fact, only a
  mask: of whom the fox</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O quanta species, inquit, cerebrum non habet."<a name="NtA_646" href="#Nt_646"><sup>[646]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I do not despair of Mr. Smith on any question which does not involve
  that unfortunate two-stick wicket at which he persists in bowling. He has
  published many papers; he has forwarded them to mathematicians: and he
  cannot get answers; perhaps not even readers. Does he think that he would
  get more notice if you were to print him in your journal? Who would study
  his columns? Not the mathematician, we know; and he knows. Would others?
  His balls are aimed too wide to be blocked by any one who is near the
  wicket. He has long ceased to be worth the answer which a new invader may
  get. Rowan Hamilton,<a name="NtA_647" href="#Nt_647"><sup>[647]</sup></a>
  years ago, completely knocked him over; and he has never attempted to
  point out any error in the short and easy method by which that powerful
  investigator condescended to show that, be right who may, he must be
  wrong. There are some persons who feel inclined to think that Mr. Smith
  should be argued with: let those persons understand that he has been
  argued with, refuted, and has never attempted to stick a pen into the
  refutation. He stated that it was a remarkable paradox, easily
  explicable; and that is all. After this evasion, Mr. James Smith is below
  the necessity of being told that he is unworthy of answer. His friends
  complain that I do nothing but <i>chaff</i> him. Absurd! I winnow him;
  and if nothing but chaff results, whose fault is that? I am usefully
  employed: for he is the type of a class which ought to be known, and
  which I have done much to make known.</p>

<p><!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>[344]</span></p>

  <p>Nothing came of this until July 1869, when I received a reprint of the
  above letter, with a comment, described as Appendix D of a work in course
  of publication on the geometry of the circle. The <i>Athenæum</i> journal
  received the same: but the Editor, in his private capacity, received the
  whole work, being <i>The Geometry of the Circle and Mathematics as
  applied to Geometry by Mathematicians, shown to be a mockery, delusion,
  and a snare</i>, Liverpool, 8vo, 1869. Mr. J.&nbsp;S. here appears in deep
  fight with Professor Whitworth,<a name="NtA_648"
  href="#Nt_648"><sup>[648]</sup></a> and Mr. Wilson,<a name="NtA_649"
  href="#Nt_649"><sup>[649]</sup></a> the author of the alleged amendment
  of Euclid. How these accomplished mathematicians could be inveigled into
  continued discussion is inexplicable. Mr. Whitworth began by complaining
  of Mr. Smith's attacks upon mathematicians, continued to correspond after
  he was convinced that J.&nbsp;S. proved an arc and its chord to be equal, and
  only retreated when J.&nbsp;S. charged him with believing in 3&#x215B;, and
  refusing acknowledgment. Mr. Wilson was introduced to J.&nbsp;S. by a
  volunteer defense of his geometry from the assaults of the
  <i>Athenæum</i>. This the editor would not publish; so J.&nbsp;S. sent a copy
  to Mr. Wilson himself. Some correspondence ensued, but Mr. Wilson soon
  found out his man, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>There is a little derision of the <i>Athenæum</i> and a merited
  punishment for "that unscrupulous critic and contemptible mathematical
  twaddler, De Morgan."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">MR. REDDIE'S ASTRONOMY.</p>

  <p>At p. 183 I mentioned Mr. Reddie,<a name="NtA_650"
  href="#Nt_650"><sup>[650]</sup></a> the author of <i>Vis Inertiæ
  Victa</i> and of <i>Victoria <span class="correction" title="text reads `tolo'"
  >toto</span> c&oelig;lo</i>,<a name="NtA_651"
  href="#Nt_651"><sup>[651]</sup></a> which last is not <!-- Page 345
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>[345]</span>an address to
  the whole heaven, either from a Roman Goddess or a British Queen,
  whatever a scholar may suppose. Between these Mr. Reddie has published
  <i>The Mechanics of the Heavens</i>, 8vo, 1862: this I never saw until he
  sent it to me, with an invitation to notice it, he very well knowing that
  it would catch. His speculations do battle with common notions of
  mathematics and of mechanics, which, to use a feminine idiom, he
  blasphemes so you can't think! and I suspect that if you do not blaspheme
  them too, <i>you</i> can't think. He appeals to the "truly scientific,"
  and would be glad to have readers who have read what he controverts,
  i.e., Newton's <i>Principia</i>: I wish he may get them; I mean I hope he
  may obtain them. To none but these would an account of his speculations
  be intelligible: I accordingly disposed of him in a very short paragraph
  of description. Now many paradoxers desire notice, even though it be
  disparaging. I have letters from more than one&mdash;besides what have
  been sent to the Editor of the <i>Athenæum</i>&mdash;complaining that
  they are not laughed at; although they deserve it, they tell me, as much
  as some whom I have inserted. Mr. Reddie informs me that I have not said
  a single word against his books, though I have given nearly a column to
  sixteen-string arithmetic, and as much to animalcule universes. What need
  to say anything to readers of Newton against a book from which I quoted
  that revolution by gravitation is <i>demonstrably</i> impossible? It
  would be as useless as evidence against a man who has pleaded guilty. Mr.
  Reddie derisively thanks me for "small mercies"; he wrote me private
  letters; he published them, and more, in the <i>Correspondent</i>. He
  gave me, <i>pro viribus suis</i>,<a name="NtA_652"
  href="#Nt_652"><sup>[652]</sup></a> such a dressing you can't think, both
  for my Budget non-notice, and for reviews which he assumed me to have
  written. He outlawed himself by declaring (<i>Correspondent</i>, Nov. 11,
  1856) that I&mdash;in a review&mdash;had made a quotation which was
  "garbled, evidently on purpose <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page346"></a>[346]</span>to make it appear that" he "was advocating
  solely a geocentric hypothesis, which is not true." In fact, he did his
  best to get larger "mercy." And he shall have it; and at a length which
  shall content him, unless his mecometer be an insatiable apparatus. But I
  fear that in other respects I shall no more satisfy him than the Irish
  drummer satisfied the poor culprit when, after several times changing the
  direction of the stroke at earnest entreaty, he was at last provoked to
  call out, "Bad cess to ye, ye spalpeen! strike where one will, there's no
  <i>plasing</i> ye!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Reddie attaches much force to Berkeley's<a name="NtA_653"
  href="#Nt_653"><sup>[653]</sup></a> old arguments against the doctrine of
  fluxions, and advances objections to Newton's second section, which he
  takes to be new. To me they appear "such as have been often made," to
  copy a description given in a review: though I have no doubt Mr. Reddie
  got them out of himself. But the whole matter comes to this: Mr. Reddie
  challenged answer, especially from the British Association, and got none.
  He presumes that this is because he is right, and cannot be answered: the
  Association is willing to risk itself upon the counter-notion that he is
  wrong, and need not be answered; because so wrong that none who could
  understand an answer would be likely to want one.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reddie demands my attention to a point which had already
  particularly struck me, as giving the means of showing to <i>all</i>
  readers the kind of confusion into which paradoxers are apt to fall, in
  spite of the clearest instruction. It is a very honest blunder, and
  requires notice: it may otherwise mislead some, who may suppose that no
  one able to read could be mistaken about so simple a matter, <!-- Page
  347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>[347]</span>let him be
  ever so wrong about Newton. According to his own mis-statement, in less
  than five months he made the Astronomer Royal abandon the theory of the
  solar motion in space. The announcement is made in August, 1865, as
  follows: the italics are not mine:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The third (<i>Victoria&nbsp;...</i>), although only published in
  September, 1863, has already had its triumph. <i>It is the book that
  forced the Astronomer Royal of England, after publicly teaching the
  contrary for years, to come to the conclusion, "strange as it may
  appear," that "the whole question of solar motion in space is at the
  present time in doubt and abeyance."</i> This admission is made in the
  Annual Report of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society, published
  in the Society's <i>Monthly Notices</i> for February, 1864."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is added that solar motion is "full of self-contradiction, which
  "the astronomers" simply overlooked, but which they dare not now deny
  after being once pointed out."</p>

  <p>The following is another of his accounts of the matter, given in the
  <i>Correspondent</i>, No. 18, 1865:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"... You ought, when you came to put me in the 'Budget,' to have been
  aware of the Report of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Society,
  where it appears that Professor Airy,<a name="NtA_654"
  href="#Nt_654"><sup>[654]</sup></a> with a better appreciation of my
  demonstrations, had admitted&mdash;'strange,' say the Council, 'as it may
  appear,'&mdash;that 'the whole question of solar motion in space [and
  here Mr. Reddie omits some words] is now in <i>doubt and abeyance</i>.'
  You were culpable as a public teacher of no little pretensions, if you
  were 'unaware' of this. If aware of it, you ought not to have suppressed
  such an important testimony to my really having been 'very successful' in
  drawing the teeth of the pegtops, though you thought them so firmly
  fixed. And if you still suppress <!-- Page 348 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>[348]</span>it, in your Appendix,
  or when you reprint your 'Budget,' you will then be guilty of a
  <i>suppressio veri</i>, also of further injury to me, who have never
  injured you...."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Reddie must have been very well satisfied in his own mind before
  he ventured such a challenge, with an answer from me looming in the
  distance. The following is the passage of the Report of the Council,
  etc., from which he quotes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And yet, strange to say, notwithstanding the near coincidence of all
  the results of the before-mentioned independent methods of investigation,
  the inevitable logical inference deduced by Mr. Airy is, that the whole
  question of solar motion in space, <i>so far at least as accounting for
  the proper motion of the stars is concerned</i>, [I have put in italics
  the words omitted by Mr. Reddie] appears to remain at this moment in
  doubt and abeyance."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Reddie has forked me, as he thinks, on a dilemma: if unaware,
  culpable ignorance; if aware, suppressive intention. But the thing is a
  <i>trilemma</i>, and the third horn, on which I elect to be placed, is
  surmounted by a doubly-stuffed seat. First, Mr. Airy has not changed his
  opinion about the <i>fact</i> of solar motion in space, but only suspends
  it as to the sufficiency of present means to give the amount and
  direction of the motion. Secondly, all that is alluded to in the
  Astronomical Report was said and printed before the Victoria proclamation
  appeared. So that the author, instead of drawing the tooth of the
  Astronomer Royal's pegtop, has burnt his own doll's nose.</p>

  <p>William Herschel,<a name="NtA_655" href="#Nt_655"><sup>[655]</sup></a>
  and after him about six other astronomers, had aimed at determining, by
  the proper motions of the stars, the point of the heavens towards which
  the solar system is moving: their results were tolerably accordant. Mr.
  Airy, in 1859, proposed an improved method, and, applying it to stars of
  large proper motion, produced <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>[349]</span>much the same result as Herschel. Mr. E.
  Dunkin,<a name="NtA_656" href="#Nt_656"><sup>[656]</sup></a> one of Mr.
  Airy's staff at Greenwich, applied Mr. Airy's method to a very large
  number of stars, and produced, again, nearly the same result as before.
  This paper was read to the Astronomical Society in <i>March</i>, 1863,
  was printed in abstract in the <i>Notice</i> of that month, was printed
  in full in the volume then current, and was referred to in the Annual
  Report of the Council in <i>February</i>, 1864, under the name of "the
  Astronomer Royal's elaborate investigation, as exhibited by Mr. Dunkin."
  Both Mr. Airy and Mr. Dunkin express grave doubts as to the sufficiency
  of the data: and, regarding the coincidence of all the results as highly
  curious, feel it necessary to wait for calculations made on better data.
  The report of the Council states these doubts. Mr. Reddie, who only
  published in <i>September</i>, 1863, happened to see the Report of
  February, 1864, assumes that the doubts were then first expressed, and
  declares that his book of September had the triumph of forcing the
  Astronomer Royal to abandon the <i>fact</i> of motion of the solar system
  by the February following. Had Mr. Reddie, when he saw that the Council
  were avowedly describing a memoir presented some time before, taken the
  precaution to find out <i>when</i> that memoir was presented, he would
  perhaps have seen that doubts of the results obtained, expressed by one
  astronomer in March, 1863, and by another in 1859, could not have been
  due to his publication of September, 1863. And any one else would have
  learnt that neither astronomer doubts the <i>solar motion</i>, though
  both doubt the sufficiency of present means to determine its
  <i>amount</i> and <i>direction</i>. This is implied in the omitted words,
  which Mr. Reddie&mdash;whose omission would have been dishonest if he had
  seen their meaning&mdash;no doubt took for pleonasm, superfluity,
  overmuchness. The rashness which pushed him headlong <!-- Page 350
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>[350]</span>into the
  quillet that <i>his</i> thunderbolt had stopped the chariot of the Sun
  and knocked the Greenwich Phaeton off the box, is the same which betrayed
  him into yet grander error&mdash;which deserves the full word,
  <i>quidlibet</i>&mdash;about the <i>Principia</i> of Newton. There has
  been no change of opinion at all. When a person undertakes a long
  investigation, his opinion is that, at a certain date, there is <i>prima
  facie</i> ground for thinking a sound result may be obtained. Should it
  happen that the investigation ends in doubt upon the sufficiency of the
  grounds, the investigator is not put in the wrong. He knew beforehand
  that there was an alternative: and he takes the horn of the alternative
  indicated by his calculations. The two sides of this case present an
  instructive contrast. Eight astronomers produce nearly the same result,
  and yet the last two doubt the sufficiency of their means: compare them
  with the what's-his-name who rushes in where thing-em-bobs fear to
  tread.</p>

  <p>I was not aware, until I had written what precedes, that Mr. Airy had
  given a sufficient answer on the point. Mr. Reddie says
  (<i>Correspondent</i>, Jan. 20, 1866):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I claim to have forced Professor Airy to give up the notion of 'solar
  motion in space' altogether, for he admits it to be 'at present in doubt
  and abeyance.' I first made that claim in a letter addressed to the
  Astronomer Royal himself in June, 1864, and in replying, very
  courteously, to other portions of my letter, he did not gainsay that part
  of it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Reddie is not ready at reading satire, or he never would have so
  missed the meaning of the courteous reply on one point, and the total
  silence upon another. Mr. Airy must be one of those peculiar persons who,
  when they do not think an assertion worth notice, let it alone, without
  noticing it by a notification of non-notice. He would never commit the
  bull of "Sir! I will not say a word on that subject." He would put it
  thus, "Sir! I will only say ten words on that subject,"&mdash;and, having
  thus said them, would <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page351"></a>[351]</span>proceed to something else. He assumed, as
  a matter of form, that Mr. Reddie would draw the proper inference from
  his silence: and this because he did not care whether or no the
  assumption was correct.</p>

  <p>The <i>Mechanics of the Heavens</i>, which Mr. Reddie sends to be
  noticed, shall be noticed, so far as an extract goes:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"My connection with this subject is, indeed, very simply explained. In
  endeavoring to understand the laws of physical astronomy as generally
  taught, I happened to entertain some doubt whether gravitating bodies
  could revolve, and having afterwards imbibed some vague idea that the
  laws of the universe were chemical and physical rather than mechanical,
  and somehow connected with electricity and magnetism as opposing
  correlative forces&mdash;most probably suggested to my mind, as to many
  others, by the transcendent discoveries made in electro-magnetism by
  Professor Faraday<a name="NtA_657"
  href="#Nt_657"><sup>[657]</sup></a>&mdash;my former doubts about
  gravitation were revived, and I was led very naturally to try and
  discover whether a gravitating body really could revolve; and I became
  convinced it could not, before I had ever presumed to look into the
  demonstrations of the <i>Principia</i>."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This is enough against the book, without a word from me: I insert it
  only to show those who know the subject what manner of writer Mr. Reddie
  is. It is clear that "presumed" is a slip of the pen; it should have been
  <i>condescended</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Reddie represents me as dreaming over paltry paradoxes. He is
  right; many of my paradoxes are paltry: he is wrong; I am wide awake to
  them. A single moth, beetle, or butterfly, may be a paltry thing; but
  when a cabinet is arranged by genus and species, we then begin to admire
  the <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>[352]</span>infinite variety of a system constructed
  on a wonderful sameness of leading characteristics. And why should
  paradoxes be denied that collective importance, paltry as many of them
  may individually be, which is accorded to moths, beetles, or butterflies?
  Mr. Reddie himself sees that "there is a method in" my "mode of dealing
  with paradoxes." I hope I have atoned for the scantiness of my former
  article, and put the demonstrated impossibility of gravitation on that
  level with Hubongramillposanfy arithmetic and inhabited atoms which the
  demonstrator&mdash;not quite without reason&mdash;claims for it.</p>

  <p>In the Introduction to a collected edition of the three works, Mr.
  Reddie describes his <i>Mechanism of the Heavens</i>, from which I have
  just quoted, as&mdash;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"a public challenge offered to the British Association and the
  mathematicians at Cambridge, in August, 1862, calling upon them to point
  to a single demonstration in the <i>Principia</i> or elsewhere, which
  even attempts to prove that Universal Gravitation is possible, or to show
  that a gravitating body could possibly revolve about a center of
  attraction. The challenge was not accepted, and never will be. No such
  demonstration exists. And the public must judge for themselves as to the
  character of a so-called "certain science," which thus shrinks from rigid
  examination, and dares not defend itself when publicly attacked: also of
  the character of its teachers, who can be content to remain dumb under
  such circumstances."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ON PARADOXERS IN GENERAL.</p>

  <p>The above is the commonplace talk of the class, of which I proceed to
  speak without more application to this paradoxer than to that. It reminds
  one of the funny young rascals who used, in times not yet quite
  forgotten, to abuse the passengers, as long as they could keep up with
  the <!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page353"></a>[353]</span>stage coach; dropping off at last with
  "Why don't you get down and thrash us? You're afraid, you're afraid!"
  They will allow the public to judge for themselves, but with somewhat of
  the feeling of the worthy uncle in <i>Tom Jones</i>, who, though he would
  let young people choose for themselves, would <i>have them</i> choose
  wisely. They try to be so awfully moral and so ghastly satirical that
  they must be answered: and they are best answered in their own division.
  We have all heard of the way in which sailors cat's-pawed the monkeys:
  they taunted the dwellers in the trees with stones, and the monkeys
  taunted them with cocoa-nuts in return. But these were silly dendrobats:
  had they belonged to the British Association they would have
  said&mdash;No! No! dear friends; it is not in the itinerary: if you want
  nuts, you must climb, as we do. The public has referred the question to
  Time: the procedure of this great king I venture to describe, from
  precedents, by an adaptation of some smart anapæstic
  tetrameters&mdash;your anapæst is the foot for satire to halt on, both in
  Greek and English&mdash;which I read about twenty years ago, and with the
  point of which I was much tickled. Poetasters were laughed at; but Mr.
  Slum, whom I employed&mdash;Mr. Charles Dickens obliged me with his
  address&mdash;converted the idea into that of a hit at mathematicasters,
  as easily as he turned the Warren acrostic into Jarley. As he observed,
  when I settled his little account, it is cheaper than any prose, though
  the broom was not stolen quite ready made:</p>

  </div>
  <p>When a paradoxer parades capital letters and diagrams which are as
  good as Newton's to all who know nothing about it, some persons wonder
  why science does not rise and triturate the whole thing. This is why: all
  who are fit to read the refutation are satisfied already, and can, if
  they please, detect the paradoxer for themselves. Those who are not fit
  to do this would not know the difference between the true answer and the
  new capitals and diagrams on which the delighted paradoxer would declare
  <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page355"></a>[355]</span>that he had crumbled the philosophers, and
  not they him. Trust him for having the last word: and what matters it
  whether he crow the unanswerable sooner or later? There are but two
  courses to take. One is to wait until he has committed himself in
  something which all can understand, as Mr. Reddie has done in his fancy
  about the Astronomer Royal's change of opinion: he can then be put in his
  true place. The other is to construct a Budget of Paradoxes, that the
  world may see how the thing is always going on, and that the picture I
  have concocted by cribbing and spoiling a bit of poetry is drawn from
  life. He who wonders at there being no answer has seen one or two: he
  does not know that there are always fifty with equal claims, each of whom
  regards his being ranked with the rest as forty-nine distinct and several
  slanders upon himself, the great Mully Ully Gue. And the fifty would soon
  be five hundred if any notice were taken of them. They call mankind to
  witness that science <i>will not</i> defend itself, though publicly
  attacked in terms which might sting a pickpocket into standing up for his
  character: science, in return, allows mankind to witness or not, at
  pleasure, that it <i>does not</i> defend itself, and yet receives no
  injury from centuries of assault. Demonstrative reason never raises the
  cry of <i>Church in Danger</i>! and it cannot have any Dictionary of
  Heresies except a Budget of Paradoxes. Mistaken claimants are left to
  Time and his extinguisher, with the approbation of all thinking
  non-claimants: there is no need of a succession of exposures. Time gets
  through the job in his own workmanlike manner as already described.</p>

  <p>On looking back more than twenty years, I find among my cuttings the
  following passage, relating to a person who had signalized himself by an
  effort to teach comets to the conductor of the <i>Nautical
  Almanac</i>:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"Our brethren of the literary class have not the least idea of the
  small amount of appearance of knowledge <!-- Page 356 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>[356]</span>which sets up the
  scientific charlatan. Their world is large, and there are many who have
  that moderate knowledge, and perception of what is knowledge, before
  which extreme ignorance is detected in its first prank. There is a public
  of moderate cultivation, for the most part sound in its judgment, always
  ready in its decisions. Accordingly, all their successful pretenders have
  <i>some pretension</i>. It is not so in science. Those who have a right
  to judge are fewer and farther between. The consequence is, that many
  scientific pretenders have <i>nothing but pretension</i>."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This is nearly as applicable now as then. It is impossible to make
  those who have not studied for themselves fully aware of the truth of
  what I have quoted. The best chance is collection of cases; in fact, a
  Budget of Paradoxes. Those who have no knowledge of the subject can thus
  argue from the seen to the unseen. All can feel the impracticability of
  the Hubongramillposanfy numeration, and the absurdity of the equality of
  contour of a regular pentagon and hexagon in one and the same circle.
  Many may accordingly be satisfied, on the assurance of those who have
  studied, that there is as much of impracticability, or as much of
  absurdity, in things which are hidden under</p>

  <p>From which it appears that, taking the selections made by satirists
  for our samples, there are, one with another, four letters more in a law
  term than in one of mathematics. But pleading has been simplified of late
  years.</p>

  <p>All paradoxers can publish; and any one who likes may read. But this
  is not enough; they find that they cannot publish, or those who can find
  they are <i>not</i> read, and they lay their plans athwart the noses of
  those who, they think, ought to read. To recommend them to be content
  with publication, like other authors, is an affront: of this I will give
  the reader an amusing instance. My good nature, of which I keep a stock,
  though I do not use it all up in this Budget, prompts me to conceal the
  name.</p>

  <p>I received the following letter, accompanied by a prospectus of a work
  on metaphysics, physics, astronomy, etc. The author is evidently one whom
  I should delight to honor:</p>

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;A friend of mine has mentioned your name in terms of
  panigeric [<i>sic</i>], as being of high standing in mathematics, and of
  greatly original thought. I send you the enclosed without comment; and,
  assuming that the bent of your mind is in free inquiry, shall feel a
  pleasure in showing you my portfolio, which, as a mathematician, you will
  acknowledge to be deeply interesting, even in an educational point of
  view. The work is complete, and the system so far perfected as to place
  it above criticism; and, so far as regards astronomy, as will Ptolemy
  beyond rivalry [<i>sic</i>: no doubt some words omitted]. Believe me to
  be, Sir, with the profoundest respect, etc. The work is the result of
  thirty-five years' travel and observation, labor, expense, and
  self-abnegation."</p>

  <p>I replied to the effect that my time was fully occupied, and that I
  was obliged to decline discussion with many persons who have views of
  their own; that the proper way is to publish, so that those who choose
  may read when they can find leisure. I added that I should advise a
  precursor in the shape of a small pamphlet, as two octavo volumes <!--
  Page 358 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>[358]</span>would
  be too much for most persons. This was sound advice; but it is not the
  first, second, or third time that it has proved very unpalatable. I
  received the following answer, to which I take the liberty of prefixing a
  bit of leonine wisdom:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Si doceas stultum, lætum non dat tibi vultum;</p>
      <p>Odit te multum; vellet te scire sepultum.<a name="NtA_658" href="#Nt_658"><sup>[658]</sup></a>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Sir,&mdash;I pray you pardon the error I unintentionally have fallen
  into; deceived by the F.R.S. [I am not F.R.S.] I took you to be a man of
  science [<i>omnis homo est animal, Sortes est homo, ergo Sortes est
  animal</i>]<a name="NtA_659" href="#Nt_659"><sup>[659]</sup></a> instead
  of the mere mathematician, or human calculating-machine. Believe me, Sir,
  you also have mistaken your mission, as I have mine. I wrote to you as I
  would to any other man well up in mathematics, with the intent to call
  your attention to a singular fact of omission by Euclid, and other great
  mathematicians: and, in selecting you, I did you an honor which, from
  what I have just now heard, was entirely out of place. I think,
  considering the nature of the work set forth in the prospectus, you are
  guilty of both folly and presumption, in assuming the character of a
  patron; for your own sense ought to have assured you that was such my
  object I should not have sought him in a De Morgan, who exists only by
  patronage of others. On the other hand, I deem it to be an unpardonable
  piece of presumption in offering your advice upon a subject the
  magnitude, importance, and real utility of which you know nothing about:
  by doing so you have offered me a direct insult. The system is a manual
  of Philosophy, a one inseparable whole of metaphysics and physic;
  embracing points the most interesting, laws the most important, <!-- Page
  359 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page359"></a>[359]</span>doctrines
  the most essential to advance man in accordance with the spirit of the
  times. I may not live to see it in print; for, at &mdash;&mdash;, life at
  best is uncertain: but, live or die, be assured Sir, it is not my
  intention to debase the work by seeking patronage, or pandering to the
  public taste. Your advice was the less needed, seeing I am an
  old-established &mdash;&mdash;. I remain, etc.&mdash;P.S. You will oblige
  me by returning the prospectus of my work."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>My reader will, I am sure, not take this transition from the
  "profoundest respect" to the loftiest insolence for an
  <i>apocraphical</i> correspondence, to use a word I find in the
  Prospectus: on my honor it is genuine. He will be better employed in
  discovering whether I exist by patronizing others, or by being patronized
  by them. I make any one who can find it out a fair offer: I will give him
  my patronage if I turn out to be Bufo, on condition he gives me his, if I
  turn out to be Bavius.<a name="NtA_660"
  href="#Nt_660"><sup>[660]</sup></a> I need hardly say that I considered
  the last letter to be one of those to which no answer is so good as no
  answer.</p>

  <p>These letters remind me in one respect of the correspondents of the
  newspapers. My other party wrote because a friend had pointed me out: but
  he would not have written if he had known what another friend told him
  just in time for the second letter. The man who sends his complaint to
  the newspaper very often says, in effect, "Don't imagine, Sir, that I
  read your columns; but a friend who sometimes does has told me ..." It is
  worded thus: "My attention <!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page360"></a>[360]</span>has been directed to an article in your
  paper of ..." Many thanks to my friend's friends for not mentioning the
  Budget: had my friend's attention been directed to it I might have lost a
  striking example of the paradoxer in search of a patron. That my Friend
  was on this scent in the first letter is revealed in the second. Language
  was given to man to conceal his thoughts; but it is not every one who can
  do it.</p>

  <p>Among the most valuable information which my readers will get from me
  is comparison of the reactions of paradoxers, when not admitted to
  argument, or when laughed at. Of course, they are misrepresented; and at
  this they are angry, or which is the same thing, take great pains to
  assure the reader that they are not. So far natural, and so far good;
  anything short of concession of a case which must be seriously met by
  counter-reasons is sure to be misrepresentation. My friend Mr. James
  Smith and my friend Mr. Reddie are both terribly misrepresented: they
  resent it by some insinuations in which it is not easy to detect whether
  I am a conscious smotherer of truth, or only muddle-headed and ignorant.
  [This was written before I received my last communication from Mr. James
  Smith. He tells me that I am wrong in saying that his work in which I
  stand in the pillory is all reprint: I have no doubt I confounded some of
  it with some of the manuscript or slips which I had received from my much
  not-agreed-with correspondent. He adds that my mistake was intentional,
  and that my reason is obvious to the reader. This <i>is</i> information,
  as the sea-serpent said when he read in the newspaper that he had a mane
  and tusks.]</p>

<p class="cenhead">THE DOUBLE VAHU PROCESS.</p>

  <p>My friend Dr. Thorn<a name="NtA_661"
  href="#Nt_661"><sup>[661]</sup></a> sees deeper into my mystery. By the
  way, he still sends an occasional touch at the old <!-- Page 361 --><span

  me particularly to tell my readers that the Latin numeral letters, if M
  be left out, give 666. And so they do: witness DCLXVI. A person who
  thinks of the origin of symbols will soon see that 666 is our number
  because we have five fingers on each hand: had we had but four, our
  mystic number would have been expressed by 555, and would have stood for
  our present 365. Had <i>n</i> been the number on each hand, the great
  number would have been</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(<i>n</i> + 1) (4<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> + 2<i>n</i> + 1)</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With no finger on each hand, the number would have been 1: with one
  finger less than none at all on each hand, it would have been 0. But what
  does this mean? Here is a question for an algebraical paradoxer! So soon
  as we have found out how many fingers the inhabitants of any one planet
  have on each hand, we have the means of knowing their number of the
  Beast, and thence all about them. Very much struck with this hint of
  discovery, I turned my attention to the means of developing it. The first
  point was to clear my vision of all the old cataracts. I propose the
  following experiment, subject of course to the consent of parties. Let
  Dr. Thorn Double-Vahu Mr. James Smith, and Thau Mr. Reddie: if either be
  deparadoxed by the treatment, I will consent to undergo it myself.
  Provided always that the temperature required be not so high as the
  Doctor hints at: if the Turkish Baths will do for this world, I am
  content.</p>

  <p>The three paradoxers last named and myself have a pentasyllable
  convention, under which, though we go far beyond civility, we keep within
  civilization. Though Mr. James Smith pronounced that I must be dishonest
  if I did not see his argument, which he knew I should not do [to say
  nothing of recent accusation]; though Dr. Thorn declared me a competitor
  for fire and brimstone&mdash;and my wife, too, which doubles the joke:
  though Mr. Reddie <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page362"></a>[362]</span>was certain I had garbled him, evidently
  on purpose to make falsehood appear truth; yet all three profess respect
  for me as to everything but power to see truth, or candor to admit it.
  And on the other hand, though these were the modes of opening
  communication with me, and though I have no doubt that all three are
  proper persons of whom to inquire whether I should go up-stairs or
  down-stairs, etc., yet I am satisfied they are thoroughly respectable
  men, as to everything but reasoning. And I dare say our several
  professions are far more true in extent than in many which are made under
  more parliamentary form. We find excuses for each other: they make
  allowances for my being hoodwinked by Aristotle, by Newton, by the Devil;
  and I permit them to feel, for I know they cannot get on without it, that
  their reasons are such as none but a knave or a sinner can resist. But
  <i>they</i> are content with cutting a slice each out of my character:
  neither of them is more than an uncle, a Bone-a-part; I now come to a
  dreadful nephew, Bone-the-whole.</p>

  <p>I will not give the name of the poor fellow who has fallen so far
  below both the <i>honestum</i> and the <i>utile</i>, to say nothing of
  the <i>decorum</i> or the <i>dulce</i>.<a name="NtA_662"
  href="#Nt_662"><sup>[662]</sup></a> He is the fourth who has taken
  elaborate notice of me; and my advice to him would be, <i>Nec quarta
  loqui persona laboret</i>.<a name="NtA_663"
  href="#Nt_663"><sup>[663]</sup></a> According to him, I scorn humanity,
  scandalize learning, and disgrace the press; it admits of no manner of
  doubt that my object is to mislead the public and silence truth, at the
  expense of the interests of science, the wealth of the nation, and the
  lives of my fellow men. The only thing left to be settled is, whether
  this is due to ignorance, natural distaste for truth, personal malice, a
  wish to curry favor with the Astronomer Royal, or mere toadyism. The only
  accusation which has truth in it is, that I have made myself a "public
  scavenger of science": the assertion, which is the <!-- Page 363 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>[363]</span>most false of all is,
  that the results of my broom and spade are "shot right in between the
  columns of" the <i>Athenæum</i>. I declare I never in my life inserted a
  word between the columns of the <i>Athenæum</i>: I feel huffed and miffed
  at the very supposition. I <i>have</i> made myself a public scavenger;
  and why not? Is the mud never to be collected into a heap? I look down
  upon the other scavengers, of whom there have been a few&mdash;mere
  historical drudges; Montucla, Hutton, etc.&mdash;as not fit to compete
  with me. I say of them what one crossing-sweeper said of the rest: "They
  are well enough for the common thing; but put them to a bit of
  fancy-work, such as sweeping round a post, and see what a mess they make
  of it!" Who can touch me at sweeping round a paradoxer? If I complete my
  design of publishing a separate work, an old copy will be fished up from
  a stall two hundred years hence by the coming man, and will be described
  in an article which will end by his comparing our century with his own,
  and sighing out in the best New Zealand pronunciation&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">ORTHODOX PARADOXERS.</p>

  <p>And pray, Sir! I have been asked by more than one&mdash;do your
  orthodox never fall into mistake, nor rise into absurdity? They not only
  do both, but they admit it of each other very freely; individually, they
  are convinced of sin, but not of any particular sin. There is not a
  syndoxer among them all but draws his line in such a way as to include
  among paradoxers a great many whom I should exclude altogether from this
  work. My worst specimens are but exaggerations of what may be found,
  occasionally, in the thoughts of sagacious investigators. At the end of
  the <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page364"></a>[364]</span>glorious dream, we learn that there is a
  way to Hell from the gates of Heaven, as well as from the City of
  Destruction: and that this is true of other things besides Christian
  pilgrimage is affirmed at the end of the Budget of Paradoxes. If
  D'Alembert<a name="NtA_665" href="#Nt_665"><sup>[665]</sup></a> had
  produced <i>enough</i> of a quality to match his celebrated mistake on
  the chance of throwing head in two throws, he would have been in my list.
  If Newton had produced <i>enough</i> to match his reception of the story
  that Nausicaa, Homer's Phæacian princess, invented the celestial sphere,
  followed by his serious surmise that she got it from the
  Argonauts,&mdash;then Newton himself would have had an appearance entered
  for him, in spite of the <i>Principia</i>. In illustration, I may cite a
  few words from <i>Tristram Shandy</i>:</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"'A soldier,' cried my uncle Toby, interrupting the Corporal, 'is no
  more exempt from saying a foolish thing, Trim, than a man of
  letters.'&mdash;'But not so often, an' please your honor,' replied the
  Corporal. My uncle Toby gave a nod."</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I now proceed to die out. Some prefatory remarks will follow in
  time.<a name="NtA_666" href="#Nt_666"><sup>[666]</sup></a> I shall have
  occasion to insist that all is not barren: I think I shall find, on
  casting up, that two out of five of my paradoxers are not to be utterly
  condemned. Among the better lot will be found all gradations of merit; at
  the same time, as was remarked on quite a different subject, there may be
  little to choose between the last of the saved and the first of the lost.
  The higher and better class is worthy of blame; the lower and worse class
  is worthy of praise. The higher men are to be reproved for not taking up
  things in which they could do some good: the lower men are to be
  commended for taking up things in which they can do no great harm. The
  circle problem is like Peter Peebles's lawsuit:</p>

<p><!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page365"></a>[365]</span></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>"'But, Sir, I should really spoil any cause thrust on me so
  hastily.'&mdash;'Ye cannot spoil it, Alan,' said my father, 'that is the
  very cream of the business, man,&mdash;... the case is come to that pass
  that Stair or Arniston could not mend it, and I don't think even you,
  Alan, can do it much harm.'"</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I am strongly reminded of the monks in the darker part of the Middle
  Ages. To a certain proportion of them, perhaps two out of five, we are
  indebted for the preservation of literature, and their contemporaries for
  good teaching and mitigation of socials evils. But the remaining three
  were the fleas and flies and thistles and briars with whom the satirist
  lumps them, about a century before the Reformation:</p>

  </div>
  <p>I should not be quite so savage with my second class. Taken together,
  they may be made to give useful warning to those who are engaged in
  learning under better auspices: aye, even useful hints; for bad things
  are very often only good things spoiled or misused. My plan is that of a
  predecessor in the time of Edward the Second:</p>

  <p>To this end I have spoken with freedom of books as books, of opinions
  as opinions, of ignorance as ignorance, of <!-- Page 366 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page366"></a>[366]</span>presumption as
  presumption; and of writers as I judge may be fairly inferred from what
  they have written. Some&mdash;to whom I am therefore under great
  obligation&mdash;have permitted me to enlarge my plan by assaults to
  which I have alluded; assaults which allow a privilege of retort, of
  which I have often availed myself; assaults which give my readers a right
  of partnership in the amusement which I myself have received.</p>

  <p>For the present I cut and run: a Catiline, pursued by a chorus of
  Ciceros, with <i>Quousque tandem? Quamdiu nos? Nihil ne te?</i><a

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

  <p>I think it right to give the proof that the ratio of the circumference
  to the diameter is incommensurable. This method of proof was given by
  Lambert,<a name="NtA_672" href="#Nt_672"><sup>[672]</sup></a> in the
  <i>Berlin Memoirs</i> for 1761, and has been also given in the notes to
  Legendre's<a name="NtA_673" href="#Nt_673"><sup>[673]</sup></a> Geometry,
  and to the English translation of the same. Though not elementary
  algebra, it is within the reach of a student of ordinary books.<a
  name="NtA_674" href="#Nt_674"><sup>[674]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Let a continued fraction, such as</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>a</i></p>
      <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
      <p><i>b</i> + <i>c</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>d</i> + <i>e</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>f</i> + etc.,</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>be abbreviated into <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+
  <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+ etc.: each fraction being understood as falling down
  to the side of the preceding sign +. In every such fraction we may
  suppose <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, etc. <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>[368]</span>positive; <i>a</i>,
  <i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, &amp;c. being as required: and all are supposed
  integers. If this succession be continued <i>ad infinitum</i>, and if
  <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>, etc. all lie
  between -1 and +1, exclusive, the limit of the fraction must be
  incommensurable with unity; that is, cannot be A/B, where A and B are
  integers.</p>

  <p>First, whatever this limit may be, it lies between -1 and +1. This is
  obviously the case with any fraction <i>p</i>/(<i>q</i> + <span
  class="grk">&omega;</span>), where <span class="grk">&omega;</span> is
  between ±1: for, <i>p</i>/<i>q</i>, being &lt; 1, and <i>p</i> and
  <i>q</i> integer, cannot be brought up to <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `±'">1</span>, by the value of <span
  class="grk">&omega;</span>. Hence, if we take any of the fractions</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>a</i>/<i>b</i>, <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>, <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>, etc.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>say <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+
  <i>g</i>/<i>h</i> we have, <i>g</i>/<i>h</i> being between ±1, so is
  <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+ <i>g</i>/<i>h</i>, so therefore is <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+
  <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+ <i>g</i>/<i>h</i>; and so therefore is
  <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+
  <i>g</i>/<i>h</i>.</p>

  <p>Now, if possible, let <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ etc. be
  A/B at the limit; A and B being integers. Let</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>P = A <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+ etc., Q = P <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+ <i>g</i>/<i>h</i>+ etc., R = Q <i>g</i>/<i>h</i> + <i>i</i>/<i>k</i> + etc.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>P, Q, R, etc. being integer or fractional, as may be. It is easily
  shown that all must be integer: for</p>

<p><!-- Page 369 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>[369]</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A/B = <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ P/A, or, P = <i>a</i>B - <i>b</i>A</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>P/A = <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ Q/P, or, Q = <i>c</i>A - <i>d</i>P</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Q/P = <i>e</i>/<i>f</i>+ R/Q, or, R = <i>e</i>P - <i>f</i>Q</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>etc., etc. Now, since <i>a</i>, B, <i>b</i>, A, are integers, so also
  is P; and thence Q; and thence R, etc. But since A/B, P/A, Q/P, R/Q, etc.
  are all between -1 and +1, it follows that the unlimited succession of
  integers P, Q, R, are each less in numerical value than the preceding.
  Now there can be no such <i>unlimited</i> succession of <i>descending</i>
  integers: consequently, it is impossible that <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+
  <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+, etc. can have a commensurable limit.</p>

  <p>It easily follows that the continued fraction is incommensurable if
  <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>, etc., being at first greater than
  unity, become and continue less than unity after some one point. Say that
  <i>i</i>/<i>k</i>, <i>l</i>/<i>m</i>,... are all less than unity. Then
  the fraction <i>i</i>/<i>k</i>+ <i>l</i>/<i>m</i>+ ... is
  incommensurable, as proved: let it be <span class="grk">&kappa;</span>.
  Then <i>g</i>/(<i>h</i> + <span class="grk">&kappa;</span>) is
  incommensurable, say <span class="grk">&lambda;</span>;
  <i>e</i>/(<i>f</i> + <span class="grk">&lambda;</span>) is the same, say
  <span class="grk">&mu;</span>; also <i>c</i>/(<i>d</i> + <span
  class="grk">&mu;</span>), say <span class="grk">&nu;</span>, and
  <i>a</i>/(<i>b</i> + <span class="grk">&nu;</span>), say <span
  class="grk">&rho;</span>. But <span class="grk">&rho;</span> is the
  fraction <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>+ <i>c</i>/<i>d</i>+ ... itself; which is
  therefore incommensurable.</p>

  <p>Take P<sub>5</sub>, and divide it by Q<sub>5</sub> in the common way,
  and the first five terms will be as here written. Now take <i>x</i> = .1,
  which means that the angle is to be one tenth of the actual unit, or, in
  degrees 5°.729578. We find that when <i>x</i> = .1, P<sub>6</sub> =
  1038.24021, Q<sub>6</sub> = 10347.770999; whence P<sub>6</sub> divided by
  Q<sub>6</sub> gives .1003346711. Now 5°.729578 is 5°43&prime;46½&Prime;;
  and from the old tables of Rheticus<a name="NtA_675"
  href="#Nt_675"><sup>[675]</sup></a>&mdash;no modern tables carry the
  tangents so far&mdash;the tangent of this angle is .1003347670.</p>

  <p>Now let <i>x</i> = ¼<span class="grk">&pi;</span>; in which case tan
  <i>x</i> = 1. If ¼<span class="grk">&pi;</span> be commensurable with the
  unit, let it be (<i>m</i>/<i>n</i>), <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> being
  integers: we know that ¼<span class="grk">&pi;</span> &lt; 1. We have

  <p>Now it is clear that <i>m</i><sup>2</sup>/3<i>n</i>,
  <i>m</i><sup>2</sup>/5<i>n</i>, <i>m</i><sup>2</sup>/7<i>n</i>, etc. must
  at last become and continue severally less than unity. The continued
  fraction is therefore incommensurable, and cannot be unity. Consequently
  <span class="grk">&pi;</span><sup>2</sup> cannot be commensurable: that
  is, <span class="grk">&pi;</span> is an incommensurable quantity, and so
  also is <span class="grk">&pi;</span><sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>I thought I should end with a grave bit of appendix, deeply
  mathematical: but paradox follows me wherever I go. The foregoing
  is&mdash;in my own language&mdash;from Dr. (now Sir David) Brewster's<a
  name="NtA_676" href="#Nt_676"><sup>[676]</sup></a> English edition of
  Legendre's Geometry, (Edinburgh, 1824, 8vo.) translated by some one who
  is not named. I picked up a notion, which others had at Cambridge in
  1825, that the translator was the late Mr. Galbraith,<a name="NtA_677"
  href="#Nt_677"><sup>[677]</sup></a> then known at Edinburgh as a writer
  and teacher.</p>

<p><!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>[373]</span></p>

  <p>But it turns out that it was by a very different person, and one
  destined to shine in quite another walk; it was a young man named Thomas
  Carlyle.<a name="NtA_678" href="#Nt_678"><sup>[678]</sup></a> He
  prefixed, from his own pen, a thoughtful and ingenious essay on
  Proportion, as good a substitute for the fifth Book of Euclid as could
  have been given in the space; and quite enough to show that he would have
  been a distinguished teacher and thinker on first principles. But he left
  the field immediately.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>(The following is the passage referred to at Vol. II, page <a
  href="#page54">54</a>.)</p>

  <p>Michael Stifelius<a name="NtA_679" href="#Nt_679"><sup>[679]</sup></a>
  edited, in 1554, a second edition of the Algebra (<i>Die Coss.</i>), of
  Christopher Rudolff.<a name="NtA_680" href="#Nt_680"><sup>[680]</sup></a>
  This is one of the earliest works in which + and - are used.</p>

  <p>Stifelius was a queer man. He has introduced into this very work of
  Rudolff his own interpretation of the number of the Beast. He determined
  to fix the character of Pope Leo: so he picked the numeral letters from
  LEODECIMVS, and by taking in X from LEO X. and striking out M as standing
  for <i>mysterium</i>, he hit the number exactly. This discovery completed
  his conversion to Luther, and his determination to throw off his monastic
  vows. Luther dealt with him as straight-forwardly as with Melanchthon
  about his astrology: he accepted the conclusions, but told him to clear
  his mind of all the premises about the Beast. Stifelius <!-- Page 374
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>[374]</span>did not take
  the advice, and proceeded to settle the end of the world out of the
  prophet Daniel: he fixed on October, 1533. The parishioners of some cure
  which he held, having full faith, began to spend their savings in all
  kinds of good eating and drinking; we may charitably hope this was not
  the way of preparing for the event which their pastor pointed out. They
  succeeded in making themselves as fit for Heaven as Lazarus, so far as
  beggary went: but when the time came, and the world lasted on, they
  wanted to kill their deceiver, and would have done so but for the
  interference of Luther. <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> Dieudonné Thiébault
  (1733-1807) was a Jesuit in his early life, but he left the order and
  took up the study of law. In 1765 he went to Prussia and became a
  favorite of Frederick the Great. He returned to France in 1785 and became
  head of the Lycée at Versailles.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> <i>Memories of Twenty Years of

  in 1805.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> Richard Joachim Heinrich von
  Mollendorff (1724-1816) began his career as a page of Frederick the Great
  (1740) and became field marshal (1793) and commander of the Prussian army
  on the Rhine (1794).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> Hugues Bernard Maret
  (1763-1839) was not Duc de Bassano in 1807, this title not being
  conferred upon him until 1809. He was ambassador to England in 1792 and
  to Naples in 1793. Napoleon made him head of the cabinet and his special
  confidant. The Bourbons exiled him in 1816.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> Denis Diderot (1713-1784),
  whose <i>Lettre sur les aveugles</i> (1749) introduced him to the world
  as a philosopher, and whose work on the <i>Encyclopédie</i> is so well
  known.</p>

  Musselburgh.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_18" href="#NtA_18">[18]</a> Jelinger Cookson Symons
  (1809-1860) was an office-holder with a decided leaning towards the
  improvement of education and social conditions. He wrote <i>A Plea for
  Schools</i> (1847), <i>The Industrial Capacities of South Wales</i>
  (1855), and <i>Lunar Motion</i> (1856), to which last work the critic
  probably refers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_19" href="#NtA_19">[19]</a> "Protimalethes" followed this
  by another work along the same line the following year, <i>The
  Independence of the Testimony of St. Matthew and St. John tested and
  vindicated by the theory of chances</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> Wilson had already taken up
  the lance against science in his <i>Strictures on Geology and Astronomy,
  in reference to a supposed want of harmony between these sciences and
  some parts of Divine Revelation</i>, Glasgow, 1843. He had also ventured
  upon poetry in his <i>Pleasures of Piety</i>, Glasgow, 1837.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_21" href="#NtA_21">[21]</a> Mrs. Borron was Elizabeth
  Willesford Mills before her marriage. She made an attempt at literature
  in her <i>Sibyl's Leaves</i>, London (printed at Devonport), 1826.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_22" href="#NtA_22">[22]</a> See Vol. I, page 386, note 10

  in 1843, was one of the earliest attempts at aviation on any extensive
  scale.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_25" href="#NtA_25">[25]</a> Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) was
  the grandfather of Charles Darwin. The work here mentioned had great
  influence, being translated into French, Portuguese, and Italian. Canning
  parodied it in his <i>Loves of the Triangles</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_26" href="#NtA_26">[26]</a> See Vol. I, page 147, note 1
  {312}.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_27" href="#NtA_27">[27]</a> The notes on this page were
  written on the day of the funeral of Wilbur Wright, June 1, 1912, the man
  who realized all of these prophecies, and then died a victim of municipal
  crime,&mdash;of typhoid fever.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_28" href="#NtA_28">[28]</a> John Charles, third Earl
  Spencer (1782-1845), to whose efforts the Reform Bill was greatly
  indebted for its final success.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_29" href="#NtA_29">[29]</a> This was published in London
  in 1851 instead of 1848.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_30" href="#NtA_30">[30]</a> This appeared in 1846.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_31" href="#NtA_31">[31]</a> This was done in <i>The Circle
  Squared</i>, published at Brighton in 1865.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_32" href="#NtA_32">[32]</a> It first appeared in 1847,
  under the title, <i>The Scriptural Calendar and Chronological Reformer,
  1848. Including a review of tracts by Dr. Wardlaw and others on the
  Sabbath question. By W.&nbsp;H. Black.</i> The one above mentioned, for 1849,
  was printed in 1848, and was also by Black (1808-1872). He was pastor of
  the Seventh Day Baptists and was interested in archeology and in books.
  He catalogued the manuscripts of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_33" href="#NtA_33">[33]</a> William Upton, a Trinity
  College man, Dublin. He also wrote <i>Upton's Physioglyphics</i>, London,
  1844; <i>Pars prima. Geometria vindicata; antiquorumque Problematum, ad
  hoc tempus desperatorum, Trisectionis Anguli, Circulique Quadraturae,
  Solutio, per Eucliden effecta, London</i> (printed at Southampton), 1847;
  <i>The Uptonian Trisection</i>, London, 1866; and <i>The Circle
  Squared</i>, London, 1872.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_34" href="#NtA_34">[34]</a> For example, if <span
  class="grk">&theta;</span> = 90° we should have 3 cos 30° = 1 + &radic;(4
  - sin<sup>2</sup> 90°), or 3.½ &radic;3 = 1 + &radic;3, or ½ &radic;3 =
  1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_35" href="#NtA_35">[35]</a> Nathaniel Wallich (1786-1854)
  was surgeon at the Danish settlement at Serampore when the East India
  Company took over the control in 1807. He entered the British medical
  service and was invalided to England in 1828. His <i>Plantae Asiaticae
  Rariores</i> (3 vols., London, 1830-1832) was recognized as a standard.
  He became vice-president of the Linnean Society, F.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S., and fellow of
  the Royal Asiatic Society.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_36" href="#NtA_36">[36]</a> But if <span

  <p><a name="Nt_37" href="#NtA_37">[37]</a> John Bonnycastle (died in
  1821) was professor of mathematics at Woolwich. His edition of Bossut's
  <i>History of Mathematics</i> (1803), and his works on elementary
  mathematics were well known.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_38" href="#NtA_38">[38]</a> The bibliographies give Husaín
  Rifki as the translator, a practical geometry as the work, and 1802 as
  the date.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_39" href="#NtA_39">[39]</a> See Vol. I, page 309, note 2
  {670}.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_40" href="#NtA_40">[40]</a> Probably in <i>The Improvement
  of the Mind</i> which Isaac Watts (1674-1748) published in 1741. His
  <i>Horae Lyricae</i> appeared in 1706, and the <i>Hymns</i>, by which he
  is still well known, in 1707.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_41" href="#NtA_41">[41]</a> Spencer Joshua Alwyne Compton,
  second Marquis of Northampton (1790-1851), was a poet, a scientist, and a
  statesman. He was president of the Royal Society from 1838 to 1849.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_42" href="#NtA_42">[42]</a> Besides the writings here
  mentioned Perigal published a work on <i>Geometric Maps</i> (London,
  1853), and <i>Graphic Demonstrations of Geometric Problems</i>
  (1891).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_43" href="#NtA_43">[43]</a> See Vol. II, page 5, note <a
  href="#Nt_18">18</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_44" href="#NtA_44">[44]</a> James Ferguson (1710-1776) was
  a portrait painter, an astronomer, and a popular writer and lecturer on
  various subjects.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_45" href="#NtA_45">[45]</a> In the old ballad of King
  Alfred and the Shepherd, when the latter is tempting the disguised king
  into his service, he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Of whig and whey we have good store,</p>
      <p>And keep good pease-straw fire."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>Whig</i> is then a preparation of milk. But another commonly cited
  derivation may be suspected from the word <i>whiggamor</i> being used
  before <i>whig</i>, as applied to the political party; <i>whig</i> may be
  a contraction. Perhaps both derivations conspired: the word
  <i>whiggamor</i>, said to be a word of command to the horses, might

  <p><a name="Nt_50" href="#NtA_50">[50]</a> It will be said that when the
  final happiness is spoken of in "sure and certain hope," it is <i>the</i>
  Resurrection, generally; but when afterwards application is made to the
  individual, simple "hope" is all that is predicated which merely means
  "wish?" I know it: but just before the general declaration, it is
  declared that it <i>has</i> pleased God of his great mercy to <i>take
  unto Himself</i>, the soul of our dear brother: and between the "hopes"
  hearty thanks are given that it <i>has</i> pleased God to deliver our
  dear brother out of the miseries of this wicked world, with an additional
  prayer that the number of the elect may shortly be accomplished. All
  which means, that our dear brother is declared to be taken to God, to be
  in a place not so miserable as this world&mdash;a description which
  excludes the "wicked place"&mdash;and to be of the elect. Yes, but it
  will be said again! do you not know that when this Liturgy was framed,
  all who were not in the road to Heaven were <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `excomunicated'">excommunicated</span> burial service
  read over them. Supposing the fact to have been true in old time, which
  is a very spicy supposition, how does that excuse the present practice?
  Have you a right <i>always</i> to say what you believe <i>cannot
  always</i> be true, because you think it was once <i>always</i> true?
  Yes, but, choose whom you please, you cannot be <i>certain</i> He is
  <i>not</i> gone to Heaven. True, and choose which Bishop you please, you
  cannot be demonstratively <i>certain</i>, he is <i>not</i> a concealed
  unbeliever: may I therefore say of the whole bench, <i>singulatim et
  seriatim</i>, that they <i>are</i> unbelievers? No! No! The voice of
  common sense, of which common logic is a part, is slowly opening the eyes
  of the multitude to the unprincipled reasoning of theologians. Remember
  1819. What chance had Parliamentary Reform when the House of Commons
  thanked the Manchester sabre-men? If you do not reform your Liturgy, it
  will be reformed for you, and sooner than you think! The dishonest
  interpretations, by defence of which even the minds of children are
  corrupted, and which throw their shoots into literature and commerce,
  will be sent to the place whence they came: and over the door of the

  <p><a name="Nt_143" href="#NtA_143">[143]</a> William George Horner
  (1786-1837) acquired a name for himself in mathematics in a curious
  manner. He was not a university man nor was he a mathematician of any
  standing. He taught school near Bristol and at Bath, and seems to have
  stumbled upon his ingenious method for finding the approximate roots of
  numerical higher equations, including as a special case the extracting of
  the various roots of numbers. Davies Gilbert presented the method to the
  Royal Society in 1819, and it was reprinted in the <i>Ladies' Diary</i>
  for 1838, and in the <i>Mathematician</i> in 1843. The method was
  original as far as Horner was concerned, but it is practically identical
  with the one used by the Chinese algebraist Ch'in Chiu-shang, in his
  <i>Su-shu Chiu-chang</i> of 1247. But even Ch'in Chiu-shang can hardly be
  called the discoverer of the method since it is merely the extension of a
  process for root extracting that appeared in the <i>Chiu-chang
  Suan-shu</i> of the second century B.&nbsp;C.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_144" href="#NtA_144">[144]</a> He afterwards edited
  Loftus's <i>Inland Revenue Officers' Manual</i> (London, 1865). The two
  equations mentioned were <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> - 2<i>x</i> = 5 and
  <i>y</i><sup>3</sup> - 90<i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + 2500<i>y</i> - 16,000 =
  0, in which <i>y</i> = 30 - 10<i>x</i>. Hence each place of <i>y</i> is
  the complement of the following place of <i>x</i> with respect to 9.</p>

  on the quadrature of the circle in 1881.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_147" href="#NtA_147">[147]</a> As it is. But what a pity
  that we have not 12 fingers, with duodecimal fractions instead of
  decimals! We should then have 0.6 for ½, 0.4 for &#x2153;, 0.8 for
  &#x2154;, 0.3 for ¼, 0.9 for ¾, and 0.16 for &#x215B;, instead of 0.5,
  0.333+, 0.666+, 0.25, 0.75, and 0.125 as we now have with our decimal
  system. In other words, the most frequently used fractions in business
  would be much more easily represented on the duodecimal scale than on the
  decimal scale that we now use.</p>

  Salt Lake City (1848).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_150" href="#NtA_150">[150]</a> Joseph Smith (1805-1844)

  <p><a name="Nt_154" href="#NtA_154">[154]</a> Olinthus Gilbert Gregory
  (1774-1841) succeeded Hutton as professor of mathematics at Woolwich. He
  was, with De Morgan, much interested in founding the University of
  London. He wrote on astronomy (1793), mechanics (1806), practical
  mathematics (1825), and Christian evidences (1811).</p>

  1675 until its dissolution in 1681. He then became professor at Rotterdam
  (1681-1693). In 1684 he began the publication of his journal of literary
  criticism <i>Nouvelles de la République des Lettres</i>. He is best known
  for his erudite <i>Dictionnaire historique et critique</i> (1697).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_159" href="#NtA_159">[159]</a> "But Christ himself does
  not prove what he promises. It is true. For, as I have said, there cannot
  be any absolute proof of future events. Therefore since it is a condition
  of future events that they cannot be grasped or comprehended by any
  efforts of anticipation, is it not more reasonable, out of two
  alternatives that are uncertain and that are hanging in doubtful
  expectation, to give credence to the one that gives some hope rather than
  to the one that offers none at all? For in the former case there is no
  danger if, as is said to threaten, it becomes empty and void; while in
  the latter case the danger is greatest, that is, the loss of salvation,
  if when the time comes it is found that it was not a falsehood."</p>

  one of the founders of Queen's College for women, and was the first
  principal of the Working Men's College, London. The subject referred to
  by De Morgan is his expression of opinion in his <i>Theological
  Essays</i> (1853) that future punishment is not eternal. As a result of
  this expression he lost his professorship at King's College. In 1866 he
  was made Knightbridge Professor of Casuistry, Moral Theology, and Moral
  Philosophy at Cambridge.</p>

  between Diameter and Circumference demonstrated by angles, and Euclid's
  Theorem, Proposition 32, Book I, proved to be fallacious</i> (Liverpool,
  1870). This is the theorem which asserts that the exterior angle of a
  triangle is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles, and
  that the sum of the interior angles equals two right angles. He also
  published his <i>Curiosities of Mathematics</i> in 1870, a work
  containing an extensive correspondence with every one who would pay any
  attention to him. De Morgan was then too feeble to show any interest in
  the final effort of the subject of some of his keenest satire.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_313" href="#NtA_313">[313]</a> Sir John Wrottesley
  (1798-1867), second Baron Wrottesley. Like Sir James South, he took up

  observations, publishing three star catalogues. He was president of the
  Astronomical Society from 1841 to 1843, and of the Royal Society from
  1854 to 1857.</p>

  be confused with Judge James Reddie (1773-1852), of Glasgow, who wrote on
  international law, although this is done in the printed edition of the
  British Museum catalogue, for he is mentioned by De Morgan somewhat later

  (1821-1902), a lawyer and writer on political economy, was a Scotchman by
  birth. He wrote on economical questions, and lectured on banking at
  Cambridge (1877) and at King's College, London (1878). He was a free
  lance in his field, and was not considered orthodox by the majority of
  economists of his time. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the chairs
  of political economy at Cambridge (1863), Edinburgh (1871), and Oxford
  (1888).</p>

  (1816-1889) was a graduate of Queen's College, Cambridge, and a clergyman
  in the Church of England until 1846, when he entered the Church of Rome.
  He taught in various Jesuit colleges until 1862, when his eccentricity
  was too marked to warrant the Church in allowing him to continue. He
  published various controversial writings during his later years. Of
  course if he had known the works of Wessel, Gaus, Buée, Argand, and
  others, he would not have made such a sorry exhibition of his ignorance
  of mathematics.</p>

  worked from 1786 to 1811 on a set of life insurance and annuity tables.
  He invented a plan known as the "columnar method" for the construction of
  such tables, and as De Morgan states, this was published by Francis
  Baily, appearing in the appendix to his work on annuities, in the edition
  of 1813. Some of his tables were used in Babbage's <i>Comparative View of
  the various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives</i> (1826).</p>

  1784. Palmer was made comptroller-general of the post office in 1786 and
  was dismissed six years later for arbitrarily suspending a deputy. He had
  been verbally promised 2½% on the increased revenue, but Pitt gave him
  only a pension of £3000. In 1813 he was awarded £50,000 in addition to

  falsely alleged that he gave before a society known as the "Friends of
  Liberty." As a matter of fact the address was given by an uneducated
  weaver, and Palmer was merely asked to revise it, declining to do even
  this. Nevertheless he was sentenced to Botany Bay (1794) for seven years.
  The trial aroused great indignation.</p>

  Geneva Bible was first printed in England, the work being done for
  Barker. He published 38 partial or complete editions of the Bible from

  1661 and went through many editions. It was the basis of Cocker's work.
  (See Vol. I, page 42, note 4 {24}.) It was long thought to have been the
  first arithmetic published in America, and it was the first English one.
  There was, however, an arithmetic published much earlier than this, in
  Mexico, the <i>Sumario compendioso ... con algunas reglas tocantes al
